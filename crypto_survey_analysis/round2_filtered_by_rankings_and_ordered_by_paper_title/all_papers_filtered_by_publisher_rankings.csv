In this Bitcoin trend analysis work, initial attributes are considered from five sectors based on financial, social, token, network, and that count to thirteen attributes. The thirteen attributes considered are price, volume, market cap, a mean dollar invested age, social volume, social dominance, development activity, transaction volume, token age consumed, token velocity, token circulation, market value to realized value, and realized cap. We apply the attribute selection and trend analysis mapped with potential seven attributes: Price, Volume, Market Cap, Social Dominance, Development Activity, Market Value to Realized Value & Realized Cap. We have conducted Nonlinear Autoregressive with External Input analysis considering seven attributes. The work employed three training algorithms to train a neural network as Levenberg-Marquard, Bayesian Regularization, and Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm. The Error histogram and regression plots results indicate that the Bayesian Regularized Neural Network is showing good performance and thus provides a better forecast."

Bitcoin is a very secure, decentralized, peer to peer currency with no third-party involvement. The price prediction of Bitcoin in the following years is a difficult task. The objective is to take a dig in the prediction of the future prices, dealing with real world data. A comparative study of the results produced by different machine learning models, along with graphs for epoch vs price, error and accuracy for each model using both linear and non-linear functions is done. We are using both neural network algorithms, such as artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), as well as some famous supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), to form the analysis. The time price prediction graphs and the epoch loss accuracy graphs are used for the analysis of each algorithm working on the same data and produces different results.

a complete vader-based sentiment analysis of bitcoin (btc) tweets during the era of covid-19,"pano t., kashef r.",big data and cognitive computing,2020,10.3390/bdcc4040033,correlation; covid-19; sentiment analysis; twitter; vader scoring,51,Journal,Q2,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many research studies have been conducted to examine the impact of the outbreak on the financial sector, especially on cryptocurrencies. Social media, such as Twitter, plays a significant role as a meaningful indicator in forecasting the Bitcoin (BTC) prices. However, there is a research gap in determining the optimal preprocessing strategy in BTC tweets to develop an accurate machine learning prediction model for bitcoin prices. This paper develops different text preprocessing strategies for correlating the sentiment scores of Twitter text with Bitcoin prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the effect of different preprocessing functions, features, and time lengths of data on the correlation results. Out of 13 strategies, we discover that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices. The prices only correlate well with sentiment scores over shorter timespans. Selecting the optimum preprocessing strategy would prompt machine learning prediction models to achieve better accuracy as compared to the actual prices. © 2020 by the authors.

a deep learning-based action recommendation model for cryptocurrency profit maximization,"park j., seo y.-s.",electronics (switzerland),2022,10.3390/electronics11091466,bitcoin; bitcoin price prediction; cryptocurrency; decision making; deep learning; input feature; profit,2,Journal,Q2,"Research on the prediction of cryptocurrency prices has been actively conducted, as cryptocurrencies have attracted considerable attention. Recently, researchers have aimed to improve the performance of price prediction methods by applying deep learning-based models. However, most studies have focused on predicting cryptocurrency prices for the following day. Therefore, clients are inconvenienced by the necessity of rapidly making complex decisions on actions that support maximizing their profit, such as “Sell”, “Buy”, and “Wait”. Furthermore, very few studies have explored the use of deep learning models to make recommendations for these actions, and the performance of such models remains low. Therefore, to solve these problems, we propose a deep learning model and three input features: sellProfit, buyProfit, and maxProfit. Through these concepts, clients are provided with criteria on which action would be most beneficial at a given current time. These criteria can be used as decision-making indices to facilitate profit maximization. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, daily price data of six representative cryptocurrencies were used to conduct an experiment. The results confirm that the proposed model showed approximately 13% to 21% improvement over existing methods and is statistically significant. © 2022 by the authors.

Though, cryptocurrencies are getting recognition form the approval bodies, but still, the uncertainty and dynamism in their prices risk the investments substantially. Cryptocurrency price prediction has become a trending research topic globally. Many machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Neural Networks (NN), and Long short-term memory (LSTM) have been used by the researchers to predict and analyze the factors affecting the cryptocurrency prices.

According to authoritative literature, the occurrence of diabetes may be related to a person's age, living environment, living habits, genes, past medical history and other factors. We can get more accurate models through machine learning training on a large amount of data, but in order to protect patients' private information between different hospitals, it is impossible to conduct training directly through data transmission. In view of this situation, we propose a solution combining homomorphic encryption and federated learning, and design and implement a privacy-protected diabetes prediction system based on federated learning. The experimental results demonstrated that it broke the phenomenon of information isolation among hospitals and successfully collected patient information from different hospitals, which could not only improve the accuracy of the trained model, but also effectively protect the privacy of patients. Therefore, this work is very innovative and practical, and has strong practical and application significance under the current social background. It can provide solutions for diabetes treatment in the medical field in the future, and it is expected to provide new ideas for multi-party data combination in different fields in the future. © 2022 IEEE."

During the ICO process, whitepapers are important not only as promotional material through which ventures can demonstrate the technical and financial project details but also as references for investors. Persuasion theory and the related literature suggest that the presentation and order of information have a significant impact on the attitude of the audience. Therefore, in addition to projects’ metadata features, we construct a document analysis deep regression model (DADRM) to innovatively extract deep text and layout features from whitepapers. Based on a real-life dataset, we conduct a comparative study to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework in predicting ICO success in terms of the funding amount. The empirical results show that our model that both extracts text content and retains the original 2D structure of the document can significantly reduce prediction error. Based on our proposed model, both ICO platforms and investors can prejudge the funding amount of cryptocurrency projects and mitigate information asymmetry. Additionally, this study demonstrates that both what is written in the business document and how the document is presented affect investor decisions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
a dropout weight-constrained recurrent neural network model for forecasting the price of major cryptocurrencies and cci30 index,"livieris i.e., stavroyiannis s., pintelas e., kotsilieris t., pintelas p.",evolving systems,2022,10.1007/s12530-020-09361-2,cci30 index; cryptocurrency; dropout; forecasting; weight-constrained neural networks,6,Journal,Q2,"Cryptocurrency is widely recognized as an alternative method for paying and exchanging currency instead of using classic coins or gold; thus, it has infiltrated almost in all financial transactions worldwide. Nowadays, cryptocurrency trade constitutes one of the most popular and promising type of profitable investments. Nevertheless, this new and constantly increasing financial market is characterized by high volatility and strong fluctuations of prices over time. As a result, it is considered essential for portfolio optimization and management, the development of a forecasting model. In this work, we propose a new time-series model based on dropout weight-constrained recurrent neural networks for forecasting cryptocurrency prices and the value of Crypto-Currency index 30 (CCi30). The proposed forecasting model exploits advanced regularization techniques for reducing the fundamental problem of overfitting. More specifically, it is characterized by the imposition of box-constraints on the weights of the network for reducing the likelihood of them blowing up to unrealistic values. Additionally, the adoption of dropout technique aims to explore hard-reaching regions of the weight space and forces the weights to away from zero. The proposed forecasting model was evaluated against state-of-the-art types of neural networks and regression models for forecasting the price of the four most widely traded digital currencies and for the prediction of CCi30 index. Our conducted experimental and detailed statistical analysis demonstrate that although weight-constrained networks give significant improvements the adoption of dropout technique in weight-constrained networks provides a boost in increasing the forecasting performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature."

With the rise of deep learning recently, various researches on forecasting the price of cryptocurrency using deep neural network have reported encouraging results in the cases of low volatility. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach which combines the advantages of non-stationary parametric models such as Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) with the nonlinear modelling potential of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The results show that our hybrid model has a similar predictive performance in terms of MSE, MAE and RMSE but higher metric scores in precision, accuracy and F1 score under optimal hyperparameters. This study reveals that the combination of parametric models like GARCH with deep neural network may come up with better results in cryptocurrency price forecasting especially in the case of highly volatile data or when short data sequences are available. Moreover, the proposed framework can be used also in other applications where high volatility and scarcity of data are the main characteristics."

This paper introduces an alternative approach in applying machine learning to block cipher cryptanalysis. Rather than trying to extract secret keys, machine learning classifiers are trained to predict a cipher's security margin with respect to the number of active s-boxes. Prediction is based on cipher features such as the number of rounds, permutation pattern, and truncated differences. Experiments are performed on a simplified generalised Feistel structure (GFS) block cipher. Prediction accuracy is optimised by refining how cipher features are represented as training data, and tuning hyperparameters. Results show that the machine learning classifiers are able formulate a relationship between the cipher features and security. When used to predict an unseen cipher (a cipher whose data was not used for training), an accuracy of up to 62% was obtained, depicting the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2020 ACM."

While conventional financial machine learning methods try to predict the price trends, reinforcement learning based portfolio management methods makes trading decisions according to the price changes directly. However, existing reinforcement learning based methods are limited in extracting the price change information at single-scale level, which makes their performance still not satisfactory. In this paper, inspired by the Inception network that has achieved great success in computer vision and can extract multi-scale features simultaneously, we propose a novel Ensemble of Identical Independent Inception (EI3) convolutional neural network, with the objective of addressing the limitation of existing reinforcement learning based portfolio management methods. With EI3, multiple assets can be processed independently while sharing the same network parameters. Moreover, price movement information for each product can be extracted at multiple scales via wide network and then aggregated to make trading decision.

Unlike forecasting the cryptocurrency returns, we propose a new approach to predict whether the return classification would be in the first, second, third quartile, or any quantile of the gold price the next day. In this paper, we employ the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for exploring the predictability of financial returns for the six major digital currencies selected from the list of top ten cryptocurrencies based on data collected through sensors. These currencies are Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Our study considers the pre-COVID-19 and ongoing COVID-19 periods. An algorithm that allows updated data analysis, based on the use of a sensor in the database, is also proposed. The results show strong evidence that the SVM is a robust technique for devising profitable trading strategies and can provide accurate results before and during the current pandemic.

Therefore, accurate cryptocurrency price forecasting is essential for market participants and regulators. It has been demonstrated that improved data forecasting accuracy can be achieved through decomposition, but few researchers have performed information extraction on the residual series generated by data decomposition. Based on the construction of a decomposition-optimization-integration hybrid model framework, in this paper, we propose a multi-scale hybrid forecasting model that combines the residual components after primary decomposition for secondary decomposition and integration. This model uses the variational modal decomposition (VMD) method to decompose the original return series into a finite number of components and residual terms. Then, the residual terms are decomposed, and the features are extracted using the completed ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) method. The components are predicted by an extreme learning machine optimized by the sparrow search algorithm, and the final predictions are summed to obtain the final results. Forecasts for the returns of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are significant cryptocurrency assets, are compared with other benchmark models constructed based on different ideas. We find that the proposed quadratic decomposition VMD-Res.-CEEMDAN-SSA-ELM hybrid model demonstrates the optimal and most stable forecasting performance in both one-step and multi-step ahead prediction of the cryptocurrency return series."

Different machine learning-based models have been integrated, and a combined prediction model has been created. The objective of the ensemble model is that it must outperform all other individual models that are used to construct the ensemble model in terms of producing excellent predictions. The field of cryptocurrencies has been selected as the domain of this work where the focus is to predict the cryptocurrency prices using the proposed model. A new regression model is proposed and implemented in this work. Different machine learning techniques have been adopted and integrated to form a combined prediction model. The machine learning models include deep neural networks, support vector regression, and decision trees. The regression scheme has to be implemented on each machine learning model separately as well as their performance is also to be improved. The combined prediction model requires optimal weights generation for integration, and therefore, time complexity is a concern.

a new privacy-preserving framework based on edge-fog-cloud continuum for load forecasting,s. hou; h. li; c. yang; l. wang,2020 ieee wireless communications and networking conference (wcnc),2020,10.1109/WCNC45663.2020.9120680,,1,Conference,CORE - B,"As an essential part to intelligently fine-grained scheduling, planning and maintenance in smart grid and energy internet, short-term load forecasting makes great progress recently owing to the big data collected from smart meters and the leap forward in machine learning technologies. However, the centralized computing topology of classical electric information system, where individual electricity consumption data are frequently transmitted to the cloud center for load forecasting, tends to violate electric consumersâ privacy as well as to increase the pressure on network bandwidth. To tackle the tricky issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework based on the edge-fog-cloud continuum for smart grid. Specifically, 1) we gravitate the training of load forecasting models and forecasting workloads to distributed smart meters so that consumersâ raw data are handled locally, and only the forecasting outputs that have been protected are reported to the cloud center via fog nodes; 2) we protect the local forecasting models that imply electricity features from model extraction attacks by model randomization; 3) we exploit a shuffle scheme among smart meters to protect the data ownership privacy, and utilize a re-encryption scheme to guarantee the forecasting data privacy. Finally, through comprehensive simulation and analysis, we validate our proposed privacy-preserving framework in terms of privacy protection, and computation and communication efficiency."
a non-cooperative resource utilization game between two competing malware,v. s. varma; y. hayel; i. -c. morärescu,ieee control systems letters,2023,10.1109/LCSYS.2022.3186620,computer networks;game theory;compartmental models,0,Journal,Q1,"In this letter, we consider a population of digital nodes (such as phones, computers, etc.) that are under the attack of two competing malware. These malware infect the nodes in order to exploit their computational resources for specific purposes such as mining crypto-currency, cloud computing, etc. We suppose that each virus spreads following the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) compartmental model. Additionally, we assume that the malware designers can tune the percentage of resource utilization from their host nodes. A higher resource utilization implies a higher instantaneous profit but will also lead to faster detection and elimination (node recovery) of the malware. Once the malware is detected, complete protection of the infected node by means of anti-malware software is also possible at a smaller rate. The proposed setup results in a non-cooperative game between the two players (the malware designers) trying to maximize their profit i.e., the resources utilized from the infected nodes. We characterize and analyze the Nash equilibrium for such a game using a time-scale separation approximation. Finally, we numerically validate the approximation and we compute the price of anarchy."
a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (narx) neural network model for the prediction of timestamp influence on bitcoin value,n. aljojo; a. alshutayri; e. aldhahri; s. almandeel; a. zainol,ieee access,2021,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124629,bitcoin (digital currency);volume of btc;bitcoin;timestamp,0,Journal,Q1,"The transaction and market of bitcoin is volatile, meaning itâs uncertain because it changes frequently. There have been a number of research studies that have presented bitcoin price prediction models, but none of them have looked at the controlling variables linked with bitcoin transaction timestamps. It might be that price is not the only key criteria influencing bitcoin transactions, or the available model for bitcoin price prediction is yet to consider timestamp as a determining factor in its transaction. A better and more accurate model would be required to predict how the Timestamp influences changes of bitcoin transactions. That is why this current study utilized a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the prediction of timestamp influence on Bitcoin value. Bitcoin historical datasets which are converted to a nonlinear regression into a âwell-formulatedâ statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression are used. Simulation analysis indicates that bitcoin digital currencyâs performance variation is highly influenced by its transaction timestamp with the prediction accuracy of 96%. The contributions of this research lies with the fact that specific Bitcoin transaction events repeat themselves over and over again, meaning that the Open-Price, High-Price, Low-Price, and Close-Price of Bitcoin price over timestamp developed a pattern that was predicted by NARX with less That means those involved in the transaction of bitcoin at the wrong timestamp will certainly face the uncertainty negative effect of the bitcoin market."

The price prediction task has various types such as shares, stocks, foreign exchange instruments, and cryptocurrency. The literature includes several models for price prediction that can be classified based on the utilized methods into three main classes, namely, deep learning, machine learning, and statistical. In this context, we proposed several models’ architectures for price prediction. Among them, we proposed a hybrid one that incorporates long short-term memory (LSTM) and Convolution neural network (CNN) architectures, we called it CNN-LSTM. The proposed CNN-LSTM model makes use of the characteristics of the convolution layers for extracting useful features embedded in the time series data and the ability of LSTM architecture to learn long-term dependencies. The proposed architectures are thoroughly evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art methods on three different types of financial product datasets for stocks, foreign exchange instruments, and cryptocurrency. The obtained results show that the proposed CNN-LSTM has the best performance on average for the utilized evaluation metrics. Moreover, the proposed deep learning models were dominant in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, machine learning models, and statistical models. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The comprehensive survey includes methodology, applications, requirements, outcomes, future directions, etc. A list of groups, organizations, and enterprises are prepared that are working in electronic health records (EHR), electronic medical records (EMR) or electronic personal records (EPR) mainly, and a comparative analysis is drawn concerning adopting the blockchain technology in their processes. This work has explored optimization algorithms applicable to Healthcare 4.0 trends and improves the performance of blockchain-based decentralized applications for the smart healthcare system. Further, smart contracts and their designs are prepared for the proposed system to expedite the trust-building and payment systems.

Privacy restrictions such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mean that such user data should not be traceable back to the original user i.e. the user's privacy should not be compromised. In this paper, we propose a system for predicting home ownership using machine learning, i.e. whether the user is likely to be a homeowner or a renter, on the basis of the user's demographic data, in a way that preserves the user's privacy while making the predictions. Our system uses differential private data perturbation along with homomorphic encryption of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors as the privacy preservation technique to mask the real identities of the users whose home ownership data is predicted. Our trained model is used for prediction on a sample dataset of a few thousand users. We get an accuracy of 69% in the prediction, which is around 4% lower than the algorithm performance without the privacy preservation. This shows that it is feasible to implement privacy preservation techniques on demographic prediction without compromising on the prediction accuracy. © 2019 IEEE."

The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin."

a temporal graph framework for intelligence extraction in social media networks,"chung w., lai v.s.",information and management,2023,10.1016/j.im.2023.103773,github; modeling; primacy; psychological theory; recency; social media analytics; social media networks; social theory,0,Journal,Q1,"Social media networks (SMNs) are increasingly used in professional management of knowledge workers and related assets. However, the factors affecting behavioral trends and activity levels in these networks are not well understood. Although social and cognitive theories can help to explain human behavior in traditional social networks, their application to SMNs has not been validated. Traditional social network modeling techniques may not accurately predict real-world SMN activities. This research developed a temporal graph framework for intelligence extraction in SMNs. Theory-based, data-driven models (Conformity Model (COM), Recency-Primacy Model (REM), Trend Interaction Model (TIM), Periodic Interaction Model (PIM)) were developed based on the framework to capture various aspects of user behavior: conformity effect, recency, primacy, periodicity, and dynamic trend. The models capture the activity history and dynamically combine pricing information to enhance predictive accuracy. Using data of 83,536 GitHub software repositories on cryptocurrency, this article reports the results of experiments that compare the models’ performance in predicting SMN activities over time. Experimental results show that the model (REM) that captures recency/primacy effects of human cognitive processing outperformed other models in 9 (out of 18) measures pertaining to engagement, contribution, influence, and popularity. Primacy plays a dominant role in predicting engagement, contribution, and popularity, whereas recency plays a key role in predicting influence. Short-term trend (modeled with TIM) was found to yield significantly better performance on predicting user contribution. The models also outperformed an integrated machine learning (IML) model by most measures. Overall, the effects modeled by REM and TIM were found to be more significant than the effects modeled by COM, PIM, and IML. The research contributes to enhancing understanding of SMN behavior, developing new models to simulate and predict SMN activities, and designing new artifacts for information systems practitioners to manage knowledge assets and to extract SMN intelligence. © 2023"

This study constructs time-series models to examine DeFi-and NFT-related cryptocurrencies and to clarify how their weekly prices fluctuated over a one-year period. Using Google Trends data, we measure how weekly Internet searches into crypto markets generally and specific branded cryptocurrencies affected price fluctuations for each coin.

In HCPSs, machine learning (ML) prediction provides reliable prediction results for users based on matured models, while security and privacy protection are considerable issues. In this article, based on the modified Okamoto-Uchiyama homomorphic encryption, we propose a verifiable privacy-preserving machine learning prediction scheme for the edge-enhanced HCPSs, which outputs the verifiable prediction results for users without privacy leakage. Specifically, a batch of prediction results can be verified at one time, which improves the efficiency of verification. Security analysis shows that our scheme protects the privacy of inputs, ML model, and prediction results. The experiment results demonstrate that the edge computing architecture remarkably alleviates the computational burden of the cloud server.

adaptive fuzzy modeling of interval-valued stream data and application in cryptocurrencies prediction,"maciel l., ballini r., gomide f.",neural computing and applications,2023,10.1007/s00521-021-06263-5,adaptive machine learning; cryptocurrencies; forecasting; fuzzy modeling; interval-valued stream data,4,Journal,Q2,"This paper introduces an adaptive interval fuzzy modeling method using participatory learning and interval-valued stream data. The model is a collection of fuzzy functional rules in which the rule base structure and the parameters of the rules evolve simultaneously as data are input. The evolving nature of the method allows continuous model adaptation using the stream interval input data. The method employs participatory learning to cluster the interval input data recursively, constructs a fuzzy rule for each cluster, uses the weighted recursive least squares to update the parameters of the rule consequent intervals, and returns an interval-valued output. The method is evaluated using actual data to model and forecast the daily lowest and highest prices of the four most traded cryptocurrencies, BitCoin, Ethereum, XRP, and LiteCoin. The performance of the adaptive interval fuzzy modeling is compared with the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, long short-term memory neural network, autoregressive integrated moving average, exponential smoothing state model, and the naïve random walk methods. Results show that the suggested interval fuzzy model outperforms all these methods in predicting prices in the digital coin market, especially when considering directional accuracy measure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
advanced social media sentiment analysis for short-term cryptocurrency price prediction,wołk k.,expert systems,2020,10.1111/exsy.12493,cryptocurrencies; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media; speculative models,26,Journal,Q3,"In recent years, the scrutiny of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal and regulated components of financial systems has been increasing. Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"
advanced turbidity prediction for operational water supply planning,"stevenson m., bravo c.",decision support systems,2019,10.1016/j.dss.2019.02.009,analytics; turbidity prediction; water quality,24,Journal,Q1,"Turbidity is an optical quality of water caused by suspended solids that give the appearance of ‘cloudiness'. While turbidity itself does not directly present a hazard to human health, it can be an indication of poor water quality and mask the presence of parasites such as Cryptosporidium. It is, therefore, a recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) that turbidity should not exceed a level of 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) before chlorination. For a drinking water supplier, turbidity peaks can be highly disruptive requiring the temporary shutdown of a water treatment works. Such events must be carefully managed to ensure continued supply; to recover the supply deficit, water stores must be depleted or alternative works utilised. Machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective for the modelling of complex environmental systems, often used to help shape environmental policy. We contribute to the literature by adopting such techniques for operational purposes, developing a decision support tool that predicts >1 NTU turbidity events up to seven days in advance allowing water supply managers to make proactive interventions. We apply a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and a Random Forest (RF) model for the prediction of >1 NTU events. AUROC scores of over 0.80 at five of six sites suggest that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting turbidity peaking events. Furthermore, we find that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost due to its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

From both the environmental and economical perspectives, non-homogeneous QoS demands obstruct the minimization of the energy footprints and operational costs of the envisioned robust networks. As such, network intelligentization is expected to play an essential role in the realization of such sophisticated aims. The fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile networks will allow for the dynamic and automatic configuration of network functionalities. Machine learning (ML), one of the backbones of AI, will be instrumental in forecasting changes in network loads and resource utilization, estimating channel conditions, optimizing network slicing, and enhancing security and encryption. However, it is well known that ML tasks themselves incur massive computational burdens and energy costs. To overcome such obstacles, we propose a novel layer-based HetNet architecture which optimally distributes tasks associated with different ML approaches across network layers and entities; such a HetNet boasts multiple access schemes as well as device-to-device (D2D) communications to enhance energy efficiency via collaborative learning and communications. © 1986-2012 IEEE."

Since key points are random and sparse, their randomness needs to be investigated to predict key points reliably. Based on measure theory, we propose an event mapping model to formally define this randomness and express it in a low dimensional and normalized space Q through mapping functions. Interestingly, when mapping functions are monotonic, the probability of a key event can be approximated by those of nested random events in Q. Based on this finding, we designed a long short-term memory based neural network to learn the mapping functions and derived an asymptotic statistical learning (ASL) algorithm. ASL automatically analyzes the convergence of random events in space Q and makes point estimates on key events in trading. Compared with 12 existing algorithms on six real datasets from NYSE, S&P 500, NASDAQ, cryptocurrency markets, etc., the algorithm ASL reliably predicts sparse key events from many random events, which provides a method to deal with the imbalance classification problem in predicting key events in trading. ASL significantly outperforms other algorithms under different market situations in both bull and bear markets. © 2001-2011 IEEE."

While this highly volatile market offers great profit opportunities to investors, it also brings risks due to its sensitivity to speculative news and the unpredictable behaviour of major investors that can cause unsual price movements. In this paper, we argue that rapid and high price fluctuations or unusual patterns that occur in this way may negatively affect the functionality of technical signals that constitute a basis for feature extraction in a machine learning (ML)-based trading system and this may cause the generalization of the model to deteriorate. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end ML-based trading system including a time series outlier detection module that detects the periods in which unusual price formations are observed. The training of the classification algorithms for the price direction prediction task was performed on the remaining data. We present the results related to the accuracy of the classification models as well as the simulation results obtained using the proposed system for real time trading on the historical data. The findings showed that the outlier detection step significantly increases return on investment for the machine learning-based trading strategies. Besides, the results showed that during the highly volatile periods the trading system becomes more profitable compared to the baseline model and buy&hold strategy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

The race between the increasing complexity of strong PUF structures and the increasing capability of modeling strong PUFs with fewer resources for training is still ongoing. In this work, we evaluate a new technique to use Transfer Learning to model strong delay-based PUF using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as the probabilistic model. Transfer Learning has been already proposed for modeling strong PUF with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Here we propose Transfer Learning for MLP, since MLP models are relatively less complex and can be trained potentially with less training data. We exploit the reusability of weight values in the hidden dense layers of an MLP model in an existing domain, to further decrease the required resources in training an MLP in another domain. Here a domain represents the the CRP space of a given strong PUF instance. We support our proposed Transfer Learning method with simulated data of some variants of XOR Arbiter PUF. We show that our proposed method can reduce the required number of CRPs by approximately 50% compared to modeling the same MLP with random initialization. © 2022 IEEE."

The limited supply, high volatility, and random price fluctuations have increased investors' interest in BTC, especially in daily trading. Although BTC has been yielding a high rate of returns, price fluctuations and constant speculations make the investors wary of unexpected price movements. Predictive modeling suffers from the complexity of the datasets (i.e., the high number of features employed to forecast BTC movements) as well as the black-box nature of most machine learning algorithms (which is especially problematic for corporate investors since they are obligated to disclose their investment decisions to their clients). Therefore, the main goal of the current study is to assist individual and corporate investors in making transparent and interpretable daily BTC trading decisions by developing a predictive analytics framework. To address the complexities posed by the datasets, a comprehensive tri-level feature selection approach is proposed. The selected features are then, fed into the Classification & Regression Tree (C&RT) to build a highly parsimonious, transparent, and interpretable prediction model. The resultant model was not only evaluated on the test (holdout) sample but was also tested on challenging time periods, including the first half of 2020 (the start of the pandemic era) to exhibit the viability and reliability of the proposed framework. Finally, a decision support tool is developed for the practical implementation of the model. The tool can be used by short-term investors not only due to its highly simplistic, transparent, and interpretable structure, but also its higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity results when compared to the extant literature. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Given the recent growth of Ethereum, the cryptocurrency community and researchers are interested in understanding the Ethereum transactions behavior. In this work, we investigate a key aspect of Ethereum: the prediction of a transaction confirmation or failure based on its features. This is a challenging issue due to the small, but still relevant, fraction of failures in millions of recorded transactions and the complexity of the distributed mechanism to execute transactions in Ethereum. To conduct this investigation, we train machine learning models for this prediction, taking into consideration carefully balanced sets of confirmed and failed transactions. The results show high-performance models for classification of transactions with the best values of F1-score and area under the ROC curve approximately equal to 0.67 and 0.87, respectively. Also, we identified the gas used as the most relevant feature for the prediction. © 2021 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s)."

In our approach, three machine learning algorithms, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), are applied to build the models that forecast the gold price. The dataset for this research is a time-series from 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2020, containing two major indices in the US (S&P 500 and DJI), two popular cryptocurrencies (BTC and ETH), two commodities (silver and crude oil), USD index (United States Dollar against Euro), and the gold prices (historical price and volatility) [24]. The evaluation benchmarks are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). In the first stage, a comparative analysis is applied to three models. In the second stage, the assessment of the impact of cryptocurrency on the models is demonstrated. It was observed that the SVR model outperforms the other two models, and our result indicates that the additional data of cryptocurrencies has a positive impact on all three models. © 2022 IEEE."
application of homomorphic encryption on neural network in prediction of acute lymphoid leukemia,"khilji i.q., saha k., shonon j.a., hossain m.i.",international journal of advanced computer science and applications,2020,10.14569/IJACSA.2020.0110646,acute lymphoid leukemia (all); cryptonets; homomorphic; neural network,3,Journal,Q3,"Machine learning is now becoming a widely used mechanism and applying it in certain sensitive fields like medical and financial data has only made things easier. Accurate Diagnosis of cancer is essential in treating it properly. Medical tests regarding cancer in recent times are quite expensive and not available in many parts of the world. CryptoNets, on the other hand, is an exhibit of the use of Neural-Networks over data encrypted with Homomorphic Encryption. This project demonstrates the use of Homomorphic Encryption for outsourcing neural-network predictions in case of Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL). By using CryptoNets, the patients or doctors in need of the service can encrypt their data using Homomorphic Encryption and send only the encrypted message to the service provider (hospital or model owner). Since Homomorphic Encryptions allow the provider to operate on the data while it is encrypted, the provider can make predictions using a pre-trained Neural-Network while the data remains encrypted all throughout the process and finally sending the prediction to the user who can decrypt the results. During the process the service provider (hospital or the model owner) gains no knowledge about the data that was used or the result since everything is encrypted throughout the process. Our work proposes a Neural Network model which will be able to predict ALL-Acute Lymphoid Leukemia with approximate 80% accuracy using the C_NMC Challenge dataset. Prior to building our own model, we used the dataset and pre-process it using a different approach. We then ran on different machine learning and Neural Network models like VGG16, SVM, AlexNet, ResNet50 and compared the validation accuracies of these models with our own model which lastly gives better accuracy than the rest of the models used. We then use our own pre-trained Neural Network to make predictions using CryptoNets. We were able to achieve an encrypted prediction of about 78% which is close to what we achieved when validating our own CNN model that has a validation accuracy of 80% for prediction of Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL). © Science and Information Organization."

We propose and implement ARTAS that automatically collects research papers and analyzes research trends. ARTAS is easy to use in various research fields because it can be customized. As the first implementation, we used ARTAS to analyze security research trend by collecting papers published by the Korea Institute of Information Security and Cryptology, ACM Computer and Communication Security, IEEE Security and Privacy, Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, and USENIX Security. As result of analysis, we figured out that it took two or three years for new keywords in the four international conferences to become popular in KIISC.

In this study, we focus on finding stable and accurate volatility predictors for a relatively new asset class of cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoin, using deep learning representations of public social media data obtained from Twitter. For our experiments, we extracted semantic information and user statistics from over 30 million Bitcoin-related tweets, in conjunction with 15-minute frequency price data over a horizon of 144 days. Using this data, we built several deep learning architectures that utilized different combinations of the gathered information. For each model, we conducted ablation studies to assess the influence of different components and feature sets over the prediction accuracy. We found statistical evidences for the hypotheses that: (i) temporal convolutional networks perform significantly better than both classical autoregressive models and other deep learning-based architectures in the literature, and (ii) tweet author meta-information, even detached from the tweet itself, is a better predictor of volatility than the semantic content and tweet volume statistics. We demonstrate how different information sets gathered from social media can be utilized in different architectures and how they affect the prediction results.

In this work, we present concretely-eficient protocols for secure 3-party computation (3PC) over a ring of integers modulo 2 tolerating one corruption, both with semi-honest and malicious security. Owing to the fact that computation over ring emulates computation over the real-world system architectures, secure computation over ring has gained momentum of late. Cast in the offline-online paradigm, our constructions present the most eficient online phase in concrete terms. In the semi-honest setting, our protocol requires communication of 2 ring elements per multiplication gate during the online phase. In the malicious setting, our protocol requires communication of 4 elements per multiplication gate during the online phase, beating the state-of-the-art protocol by 5 elements. Realized with both the security notions of selective abort and fairness, the malicious protocol with fairness involves a slightly more communication than its counterpart with abort security for the output gates alone. We apply our techniques from 3PC in the regime of secure server-aided machine-learning (ML) inference for a range of prediction functions-linear regression, linear SVM regression, logistic regression, and linear SVM classification. Our setting considers a model-owner with trained model parameters and a client with a query, with the latter willing to learn the prediction of her query based on the model parameters of the former. The inputs and computation are outsourced to a set of three non-colluding servers. Our constructions catering to both semi-honest and malicious world, invariably perform better than the existing constructions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery."

Specific research has been done on cryptocurrencies’ price prediction while the prices surge up. Classic models and recurrent neural networks are applied for the time series forecast. However, there remains limited research on how the Transformer works on forecasting cryptocurrencies price data. This paper investigated the forecasting capability of the Transformer model on Bitcoin (BTC) price data and Ethereum (ETH) price data which are time series with high fluctuation. Long short term memory model (LSTM) is employed for performance comparison. The result shows that LSTM performs better than Transformer both on BTC and ETH price prediction. Furthermore, in this paper, we also investigated if sentiment analysis can help improve the model’s performance in forecasting future prices. Twitter data and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) is used for getting sentiment scores. The result shows that the sentiment analysis improves the Transformer model’s performance on BTC price but not ETH price. For the LSTM model, the sentiment analysis does not help with prediction results. Finally, this paper also shows that transfer learning can help on improving the Transformer’s prediction ability on ETH price data.

To restore the computer's functionality and user files, the malware demands a ransom, which must be paid in the form of cryptocurrency within a stipulated period. The deleterious effects caused by ransomware must be detected and addressed promptly. It is often difficult to perceive the metrics and parameters to look for, particularly when conducting experiments with unfamiliar ransomware variants. Traditionally, analysis carried out on these suspicious files can be categorized as static or dynamic based analysis. Static-based signature analysis is tremendously affected because of its nature of generating hard-coded policies or rules. Attackers often attempt to breach them by employing various techniques like code obfuscation, encryption, packaging, etc. While the dynamic analysis provides more insights into the analyzed files. The proposed work observes the behavioral aspects of ransomware and builds a generic model using machine learning techniques to detect the variants of ransomware families. Such threats must be detected early, i.e., before encryption takes place. Early detection, however, is hampered by a lack of sufficient information in the early stages of an attack, which leads to low detection accuracy and a high rate of false alarms. Currently, available solutions assume that there is complete knowledge of the behavior of such attacks at the time of detection, but that is not the case. The same is not true for early detection which takes place during an attack when the data are not fully accessible. Our paper proposes a novel technique to address these limitations called Augmented Bootstrapping and this method analyses the API calls made by the ransomware along with their timestamps. These timestamps indicate the API call sequences, which in turn help in constructing the N-gram model. The names of API calls are concatenated together to generate the bigram, trigram, 4-gram, and 5-gram models. Further, TF-IDF scores will be calculated for each of these N-grams sequences, and a machine learning model will be trained based on these values. The method analyses API call sequences of each of the active applications in the system and confirms the ransomware attack when it matches a malicious call sequence pattern. Our empirical results confirm that the proposed work could detect ransomware attacks with high accuracy and fewer false predictions."

At present it is the most successful cryptocurrency compared to other altcoins dispersed in the world economy. The Bitcoin prices fluctuate like other stock markets due to inherent volatility. The investors’ confidence on Bitcoin rising fast and have been reflected on its prices. Though few computational intelligence methods are available, sophisticated methodologies for accurate prediction of Bitcoin are still lacking and need to be explored. Functional link neural network (FLN) is a flat network, offers lower computational complexity, and achieves enhanced input–output nonlinearity mapping through functional expansion of input signals. Basis functions such as Legendre, Trigonometric, Laguerre, and Chebyshev are commonly used polynomials in FLN for expansion of input signal dimension. In this article along with the weight and bias vector of FLNs, optimal number of polynomial functions for each category of basis function is selected by genetic algorithm during training process rather fixing them earlier. Therefore, an optimal FLN structure is crafted on fly from exploitation of training data. The optimal FLN models are used to predict the daily, weekly, and monthly closing prices of Bitcoin. A comparative study among optimal FLNs is carried out using evaluation metrics such as MAPE, NMSE, ARV, and U of Theil’s statistics.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components.

Predicting the future value of bitcoin can help investors to make more educated decisions and to provide authorities with a point of reference for evaluating cryptocurrency. The novelty of the proposed prediction models lies in the use of artificial intelligence to identify movement cryptocurrency prices, particularly bitcoin prices. A forecasting model that can accurately and reliably predict the market’s volatility and price variations is necessary for portfolio management and optimization in this continually expanding financial market. In this paper, we investigate a time series analysis that makes use of deep learning to investigate volatility and provide an explanation for this behavior. Our findings have managerial ramifications, such as the potential for developing a product for investors. This can help to expand upon our model by adjusting various hyperparameters to produce a more accurate model for predicting the price of cryptocurrencies. Another possible managerial implication of our findings is the potential for developing a product for investors, as it can predict the price of cryptocurrencies more accurately. The proposed models were evaluated by collecting historical bitcoin prices from 1 January 2021 to 16 June 2022. The results analysis of the GRU and MLP models revealed that the MLP model achieved highly efficient regression, at R = 99.15% during the training phase and R = 98.90% during the testing phase. These findings have the potential to significantly influence the appropriateness of asset pricing, considering the uncertainties caused by digital currencies. In addition, these findings provide instruments that contribute to establishing stability in cryptocurrency markets. By assisting asset assessments of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, our models deliver high and steady success outcomes over a future prediction horizon. In general, the models described in this article offer approximately accurate estimations of the real value of the bitcoin market. Because the models enable users to assess the timing of bitcoin sales and purchases more accurately, they have the potential to influence the economy significantly when put to use by investors and traders. © 2022 by the authors."

We work under the hypothesis that price is affected by the web footprint of influential people, we refer to them as crypto-influencers. In this paper we provide neural models for predicting bitcoin price. We compare what happens when the model is fed only with recent price history versus what happens when fed, in addition, with a measure of the positivity or negativity of the sayings of these influencers, measured through a sentiment analysis of their twitter posts. We show preliminary evidence that twitter data should indeed help to predict the price of bitcoin, even though the measures we use in this paper have a lot of room for refinement.

This has led to the creation of numerous brands of cryptocurrencies. It was only after the boom in their price in 2011 that they began to be regarded as an investment asset. Since these coins are highly volatile in their pricing, there is a need for a good prediction of their closing price on which investment decisions can be made. To address this requirement, this paper studies the relative performances of different machine learning algorithms for a well-known cryptocurrency - the 'Bitcoin'. The performance measures of different machine learning models were undertaken to get the accuracy of the models for Bitcoin and results were obtained.

However, its volatility and brand new trading mode has made it challenging to devising an acceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm — proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning. Visualizations of trading the process show how the model handles high-frequency transactions to provide inspiration and demonstrate that it can be expanded to other financial products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Such connected, intelligent and collaborative transportation systems represent a promising trend towards smart roads and cities. However, the safety-critical aspect of these cyber-physical systems requires a systematic study of their security and privacy. In fact, security-sensitive information could be transmitted between vehicles, or between vehicles and the infrastructure such as security alerts, payment, etc. Since asymmetric cryptography is heavy to implement on embedded time-critical devices, in addition to the complexity of PKI-based solutions, symmetric cryptography offers confidentiality along with high performance. However, cryptographic key generation and establishment in symmetric cryptosystems is a great challenge. Recent work proposed a key generation and establishment protocol for ve-hicular communication that is based on the reciprocity and high spatial and temporal variation properties of the vehicular communication channel. This paper investigates the limitations of such channel-based key generation protocols. Based on a channel model with a machine learning approach, we show the possibility for a passive eavesdropper to compromise the secret key in a practical manner, thereby undermining the security of such key establishment technique.

Our C2P2 algorithm is the first algorithm to consider the fact that the price of a cryptocurrency c might depend not only on historical prices, sentiments, global stock indices, but also on the prices and predicted prices of other cryptocurrencies. C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time - rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16%. In both cases, C2P2 is the winner on all cryptocurrencies considered. Moreover, we experimentally show that the use of similarity metrics within our C2P2 algorithm leads to a direct improvement for 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies ranging from 0.4% to 17.8%. Without the similarity component, C2P2 still beats competitors on 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies considered. We show that all these results are statistically significant via a Student's t-test with p < 10^-5. © 2019 IEEE."

A natural question is then to ask whether dynamics of the transaction graph impacts price of the underlying cryptocurrency. We show that standard graph features such as degree distribution of the transaction graph may not be sufficient to capture network dynamics and its potential impact on fluctuations of Bitcoin price. In contrast, topological features computed from the blockchain graph using the tools of persistent homology, are found to exhibit higher utility for predicting Bitcoin price dynamics."

Traditional PLA schemes exploiting channel state information (CSI) face significant challenges in mobile communication scenarios due to the unknown variation of wireless channels. To address this challenge, we propose a PLA scheme based on Gaussian process (GP) channel prediction, where the variation of channel characteristics is tracked and predicted. Specifically, historical CSI attributes together with the transmitter's geographical information are exploited to establish a mapping to predict the next legitimate CSI for authentication. Furthermore, to overcome the impracticality of applying conventional PLA framework for authentication, where an unrealistic assumption that either the prior knowledge of the adversary's statistical channel model or even the real observations of its CSI data is required, we propose the so-called one-class authentication (OCA) scheme, which does not require any attacker's channel information. We exploit the quasideterministic radio channel generator (QuaDRiGa) simulation platform as the generator of CSI for experimental verifications. Simulation tests are performed to demonstrate that our method improves authentication performance significantly in time-varying scenarios. © 2014 IEEE."

A major factor driving this phenomenon is the proliferation of large networks of poorly secured IoT devices. This is exacerbated by the commoditization of the malware development industry, in which tools can be readily obtained in specialized hacking forums or underground markets. However, despite the great interest in targeting this infrastructure, there is little understanding of what the main features of this type of malware are, or the motives of the criminals behind it, apart from the classic denial of service attacks. This is vital to modern malware forensics, where analyses are required to measure the trustworthiness of files collected at large during an investigation, but also to confront challenges posed by tech-savvy criminals (e.g., Trojan Horse Defense). In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of Linux-based malware. Our study is tailored to IoT malware and it leverages automated techniques using both static and dynamic analysis to classify malware into related threats. By looking at the most representative dataset of Linux-based malware collected by the community to date, we are able to show that our system can accurately characterize known threats. As a key novelty, we use our system to investigate a number of threats unknown to the community. We do this in two steps. First, we identify known patterns within an unlabeled dataset using a classifier trained with the labeled dataset. Second, we combine our features with a custom distance function to discover new threats by clustering together similar samples. We further study each of the unknown clusters by using state-of-the-art reverse engineering and forensic techniques and our expertise as malware analysts. We provide an in-depth analysis of what the most recent unknown trends are through a number of case studies. Among other findings, we observe that: i) crypto-mining malware is permeating the IoT infrastructure, ii) the level of sophistication is increasing, and iii) there is a rapid proliferation of new variants with minimal investment in infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

While uptake of this new medium is relatively slow, we feel the prospects of blockchain technology are up-and-coming. NFTs are still largely misunderstood by the wider community, and as such, this provides a fascinating opportunity to explore the NFT marketplace in greater depth. We analyzed sales data from OpenSea - the NFT marketplace with the most extensive user base and sales volume. Our study considered 5.25 million sales that occurred between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. We first lead by presenting an overview of our data collection process and summarizing key statistics of the data set. We examine user behaviour in the market to show that a small subset of heavy-hitters is driving massive growth. Secondly, we review the economic activity within the network to show how these power users drive extreme price volatility within the Art and Collectible categories. Lastly, we review the network of buyers and sellers to show that despite the sparsity that exists in the network, communities of users are forming, and most power users tend to congregate in these structures. These findings shed light on areas of the NFT marketplace that have been relatively unexamined and provide a multi-level analysis of a multi-billion dollar market. © 2022 ACM."

Transcriptomic analysis of blood samples has emerged as a potential means to identify biomarkers and gene signatures of PD. In this context, classification algorithms can assist in detecting data patterns such as phenotypes and transcriptional signatures with potential diagnostic application. In this study, we performed gene expression meta-analysis of blood transcriptome from PD and control patients in order to identify a gene-set capable of predicting PD using classification algorithms. We examined microarray data from public repositories and, after systematic review, 4 independent cohorts (GSE6613, GSE57475, GSE72267 and GSE99039) comprising 711 samples (388 idiopathic PD and 323 healthy individuals) were selected. Initially, analysis of differentially expressed genes resulted in minimal overlap among datasets. To circumvent this, we carried out meta-analysis of 17,712 genes across datasets, and calculated weighted mean Hedges' g effect sizes. From the top-100- positive and negative gene effect sizes, algorithms of collinearity recognition and recursive feature elimination were used to generate a 59-gene signature of idiopathic PD. This signature was evaluated by 9 classification algorithms and 4 sample size-adjusted training groups to create 36 models. Of these, 33 showed accuracy higher than the non-information rate, and 2 models built on Support Vector Machine Regression bestowed best accuracy to predict PD and healthy control samples.

New bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that the demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Actually, the price is highly volatile, because it is affected by many factors including the supply of bitcoin, its market demand, the cost of the mining process, as well as economic and political world-class news. In this work, we illustrate a novel approach for bitcoin trend prediction, based on the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). First, we propose a methodology for building useful datasets that take into account social media data, the full blockchain transaction history, and a number of financial indicators. Moreover, we present a cloud-based system characterized by a highly efficient distributed architecture, which allowed us to collect a huge amount of data in order to build thousands of different datasets, using the aforementioned methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses 1D CNN for bitcoin trend prediction. Remarkably, an efficient and low-cost implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNN models that perform one-dimensional convolutions (i.e., scalar multiplications and additions). We show that the 1D CNN model we implemented, trained, validated and tested using the aforementioned datasets, allow one to predict the bitcoin trend with higher accuracy compared to LSTM models. Last but not least, we introduce and simulate a trading strategy based on the proposed 1D CNN model, which increases the profit when the bitcoin trend is bullish and reduces the loss when the trend is bearish. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

But it is also the continuation of the evaluation of post-quantum cryptographic schemes against this class of attack. Particularly, we review the BLISS implementation provided by the strongSwan project. This implementation particularly stores its private key in memory in an interesting way therefore requiring novel approaches to key recovery. We present various approaches to key recovery. We first analyse the key recovery problem in this particular case via key enumeration algorithms, and so propose different techniques for key recovery. We then turn our attention to exploit further the algebraic relation among the components of the private key, and we thus establish a connection between the key recovery problem in this particular case and an instance of Learning with Errors Problem (LWE). We then explore various key recovery techniques to tackle this instance of LWE. In particular, we show a key recovery strategy combining lattice techniques and key enumeration. Finally, we report results from experimenting with one of the key recovery algorithms for a range of parameters, showing it is able to tolerate a noise level of alpha = 0.001 and beta = 0.09 for a parameter set when performing a 2(40) enumeration."

Collision resistant hash functions are one of the more useful cryptographic primitives both in theory and in practice and two prominent applications are in signature schemes and succinct zero-knowledge arguments. In this work we consider a relaxation of the above requirement that we call Multi-CRH: a function where it is hard to find x(1), x(2), ..., x(k) which are all distinct, yet h(x(1)) = h(x(2)) = center dot center dot center dot = h(x(k)). We show that for some of the major applications of CRH functions it is possible to replace them by the weaker notion of a Multi-CRH, albeit at the price of adding interaction: we show a constant-round statistically-hiding commitment scheme with succinct interaction (committing to poly(n) bits requires exchanging (O) over tilde (n) bits) that can be opened locally (without revealing the full string). This in turn can be used to provide succinct arguments for any NP statement. We formulate four possible worlds of hashing-related assumptions (in the spirit of Impagliazzo's worlds). They are (1) Nocrypt, where no one-way functions exist, (2) Unihash, where one-way functions exist, and hence also UOWHFs and signature schemes, but no Multi-CRH functions exist, (3) Minihash, where Multi-CRH functions exist but no CRH functions exist, and (4) Hashomania, where CRH functions exist. We show that these four worlds are distinct in a black-box model: we show a separation of CRH from Multi-CRH and a separation of Multi-CRH from one-way functions."

Volatility measures the variation of a time series data, and thus it is also a driving factor for the risk forecasting of returns from investment in cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is a decentralized medium of exchange that relies on cryptographic primitives to facilitate the trustless transfer of value between different parties. Instead of being physical money, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries on an online ledger called blockchain that describe specific transactions.Many commonly used risk forecasting models do not take into account the uncertainty associated with the volatility of an underlying asset to obtain the risk forecasts. Some tools from the fuzzy set theory can be incorporated into the forecasting models to account for this uncertainty. Interest in the use of hybrid models for fuzzy volatility forecasts is growing. However, a major drawback is that the fuzzy coefficient hybrid models used in fuzzy volatility forecasts are not data-driven. This paper uses fuzzy set theory with data-driven volatility and data-driven neuro-volatility forecasts to study the fuzzy risk forecasts. The study focuses on long-term volatility forecasts with daily price data while briefly exploring forecasting models with high-frequency (hourly) data as an avenue for future research. Simple yet effective models incorporating fuzziness to obtain fuzzy risk volatility forecasts and fuzzy VaR forecasts are presented. The key underlying idea, unlike the existing risk forecasting, is the use of a hybrid nonlinear adaptive fuzzy model for volatility."

The statistical data analysis of the top 5 coins in the market has been undertaken effectively using IBM Watson services. Further enhancements have been made using the jupyter notebook to predict the market highs of the top trending coins. The sentimental evaluation has been done by extracting Twitter trends and hashtags thereby judging the sentiments of the microblogging site and paving a way to predict the exact emotion of investors all over the globe. Findings: Finally, we believe that this research has immense capability to predict the market speculation using the various technologies that are still in the rudimentary phase and has a lot of potential in invoking the interest of researchers and providing useful data/cognizance for future investors. © 2021 IEEE."

Bitcoin was introduced as the first cryptocurrency to allow direct online payments without relying on centralized financial entities. The use of Bitcoin has vastly grown as a financial asset rather than just a tool for online payments. A lot of cryptocurrencies have been created since 2011 with Bitcoin dominating the cryptocurrencies' market. With plenty of cryptocurrencies being used as financial assets and with millions of trades being executed through different exchange services, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to trading problems and challenges similar to those traditionally encountered in the financial domain. Price and trend prediction, volatility prediction, portfolio construction and fraud detection are some examples related to trading. In addition, there are other challenges that are specific to the domain of cryptocurrencies such as mining, cybersecurity, anonymity and privacy. In this paper, we survey the application of artificial intelligence techniques to address these challenges for cryptocurrencies with their vast amount of daily transactions, trades and news that are beyond human capabilities to analyze and learn from. This paper discusses the recent research work done in this emerging area and compares them in terms of used techniques and datasets. It also highlights possible research gaps and some potential areas for improvement. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Identification of such relations is crucial because their existence may be used to create a broad spectrum of analyses and reports about cryptocurrency projects and to obtain a comprehensive outlook of the blockchain domain. The activities on the blockchain reach different levels of anonymity which renders them hard objects of studies. In particular, the standard tools used to characterize social trends and variables that describe cryptocurrencies' situations are unsuitable to be used in the environment that extensively employs cryptographic techniques to hide real users. The employment ofWikipedia to trace crypto assets value need examination because the portal allows gathering of different opinions-content of the articles is edited by a group of people. Consequently, the information can be more attractive and useful for the readers than in case of non-collaborative sources of information. Wikipedia Articles often appears in the premium position of such search engines as Google, Bing, Yahoo and others. One may expect different demand on information about particular cryptocurrency depending on the different events (e.g., sharp fluctuations of price). Wikipedia offers only information about cryptocurrencies that are important from the point of view of language community of the users inWikipedia. This ""filter"" helps to better identify those cryptocurrencies that have a significant influence on the regional markets. The models encompass linkages between different variables and properties. In one model cryptocurrency projects are ranked with the means of articles sentiment and quality. In another model, Wikipedia visits are linked to cryptocurrencies' popularity. Additionally, the interactions between information demand in different Wikipedia language versions are elaborated. They are used to assess the geographical esteem of certain crypto coins. The information about the legal status of cryptocurrency technologies in different states that are offered by Wikipedia is used in another proposed model. It allows assessment of the adoption of cryptocurrencies in a given legislature. Finally, a model is developed that joins Wikipedia articles editions and deletions with the social sentiment towards particular cryptocurrency projects. The mentioned analytical purposes that permit assessment of the popularity of blockchain technologies in different local communities are not the only results of the paper.

This work proposes the use of Mamdani interpretable fuzzy inference models for forecasting cryptocurrency price variation. For that, a genetic algorithm to optimize models accuracy is employed, limiting the quantity of rules and antecedents arbitrarily. A set of infeasible rules had to be discarded, in order to generate interesting models, that produce a relevant amount of trades. Data from Kraken exchange were utilized for training, validation and results assessment. Results have shown that, for the cryptocurrencies with the highest validation performances, there are gains in comparison to the simple currency appreciation. Using the interpretable aspect of the models, it should be possible to obtain even higher profits."

Since cryptocurrency malware threats perform a legal process, it is a challenging task to detect this type of threat by a manual or heuristic method. In this paper, we propose a novel deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) learning model for hunting cryptocurrency malware threats. Specifically, our proposed model utilizes the RNN to analyze Windows applications’ operation codes (Opcodes) as a case study. We collect a real-world dataset that comprises of 500 cryptocurrency malware and 200 benign-ware samples, respectively. The proposed model trains with five different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) structures and is evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) technique. The obtained results prove that a 3-layer configuration model gains 98% of detection accuracy, which is the highest rate among other current configurations. We also applied traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers to show the applicability of deep learners (LSTM) versus traditional models in dealing with cryptocurrency malware. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

Therefore, privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) aims at providing privacy using techniques such as secure multi-party computation (SMPC). Recent years have seen a rapid influx of cryptographic frameworks that steadily improve performance as well as usability, pushing PPML towards practice. However, as it is mainly driven by the crypto community, the PPML toolkit so far is mostly restricted to well-known neural networks (NNs). Unfortunately, deep probabilistic models rising in the ML community that can deal with a wide range of probabilistic queries and offer tractability guarantees are severely underrepresented. Due to a lack of interdisciplinary collaboration, PPML is missing such important trends, ultimately hindering the adoption of privacy technology. In this work, we introduce CryptoSPN, a framework for privacy-preserving inference of sum-product networks (SPNs) to significantly expand the PPML toolkit beyond NNs. SPNs are deep probabilistic models at the sweet-spot between expressivity and tractability, allowing for a range of exact queries in linear time. In an interdisciplinary effort, we combine techniques from both ML and crypto to allow for efficient, privacy-preserving SPN inference via SMPC. We provide CryptoSPN as open source and seamlessly integrate it into the SPFlow library (Molina et al., arXiv 2019) for practical use by ML experts. Our evaluation on a broad range of SPNs demonstrates that CryptoSPN achieves highly efficient and accurate inference within seconds for medium-sized SPNs. © 2020 ACM."

Fuzzy set theory has a unique ability to quantitatively and qualitatively model and analyze such problems. Volatility forecasting plays an important role in financial risk management and in option pricing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in data-driven volatility models and neurovolatility models for risk forecasting of stocks and index funds. However, even these state-of-the-art models do not take into account the fuzzy volatility in their risk forecasts.Cryptocurrencies are a novel financial asset class based on the Blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity among retail investors as a financial asset with high risks and high returns. The extremely volatile nature of cryptocurrencies (compared to traditional assets) makes forecasting their volatility more challenging. A simple algorithmic trading approach, Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy, is used to calculate the Algo returns. This paper provides fuzzy forecasts of the volatility of Algo returns using the data-driven Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (DD-EWMA) and neuro models for six major cryptocurrencies. We also compute and compare fuzzy volatility forecasts of four major tech stocks and Chicago Board Options Exchangeâs (CBOE) volatility index (VIX) using DD-EWMA and neuro models. Our experimental results show that the data-driven models produce better forecasts for cryptocurrencies as compared to the neuro models, while for the regular stocks and indexes, no such definitive conclusion could be drawn."

Due to attractiveness of Bitcoin in terms of returns and risk, Bitcoin price prediction is attracting a growing attention from both investors and researchers. Indeed, with the development of machine learning and especially deep learning, forecasting Bitcoin is receiving a particular interest. Methods We implement and apply deep forward neural network (DFFNN) for the analysis and forecasting Bitcoin high-frequency price data. Importantly, we seek to investigate the effect of standard numerical training algorithms on the accuracy obtained by DFFNN; namely, the conjugate gradient with Powell-Beale restarts, the resilient algorithm, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The DFFNN was applied to a big dataset composed of 65,535 samples. Results In terms of root mean of squared errors (RMSEs), the simulation results show that the DFFNN trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm outperforms DFFNN trained with Powell-Beale restarts algorithm and DFFNN trained with resilient algorithm. In addition, the resilient algorithm is fast which suggests that it could be promising in online training and trading. Conclusions The DFFNN trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is effective and easy to implement for Bitcoin high-frequency price data forecasting."

Cryptocurrency price prediction is a challenging problem with non-stationary market price and volatility clustering. Cryp-tocurrency data tends to be non-stationary, which means that predictive information extracted using deep learning techniques on observed data can not be used with future data. Moreover, there is a very little signal in cryptocurrency data to indicate the future direction of the market. This paper proposes a sensible way to frame the prediction problem as a dynamic regression problem by defining the features in the feedforward neural networks and the target as an appropriate average of the historical data. The novelty of this paper is to use deep learning algorithms and statistical bootstrapping to obtain cryptocurrency price prediction and the corresponding prediction intervals. It is shown that neural networks are capable of modelling nonlinearity directly for nonlinear time series models. The proposed hybrid approach is evaluated using simulated and cryptocurrency data through numerical experiments. Moreover, Gaussian and boot-strap prediction intervals for the price and the volatility of the prediction errors, are also discussed in some detail. © 2022 IEEE."

It gives an edge over the traditional centralized methods as it provides decentralization, immutability, integrity, and anonymity. The most popular application of this technology is cryptocurrencies, which showed a massive rise in their popularity and market capitalization in recent years. Individual investors, big institutions, and corporate firms are investing heavily in it. However, the crypto market is less stable than traditional commodity markets. It can be affected by many technical, sentimental, and legal factors, so it is highly volatile, uncertain, and unpredictable. Plenty of research has been done on various cryptocurrencies to forecast accurate prices, but the majority of these approaches cannot be applied in real-time. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, in this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based hybrid model (includes Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) to predict the price of Litecoin and Zcash with inter-dependency of the parent coin. The proposed model can be used in real-time scenarios and it is well trained and evaluated using standard data sets.

Training a deep learning model for commercial use requires plenty of private data, expert knowledge, and computing resources. The huge commercial value of such trained models has attracted the attention of attackers. Attackers can construct a dataset by repeatedly querying the target model for the output of the requested samples and then train a substitute model on this dataset that functions similarly to the target model. In this paper, we propose a defense scheme based on physical unclonable function (PUF) against such black-box model extraction attacks. We deploy a PUF on the user side and the corresponding PUF model on the service provider side to ensure that only legitimate users can obtain the correct model predictions. Our experimental results show that by choosing a suitable fuzzy extractor threshold d, legitimate users can recover more than 99.5% of the prediction results with a little additional computational overhead to the service provider. We perform a model extraction attack in the most favorable case for the attacker, and the prediction accuracy of the obtained substitute model is only about 10%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Compared to existing defenses, our scheme not only effectively prevents black-box model extraction attacks but also ensures that the accuracy of the prediction service for legitimate users is not affected. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

In order to mitigate the situation, efficient strategies have been proposed for generation, distribution and consumption of energy obtained from renewable sources such as tidal, wind and solar power. With the advent of Smart Grids being developed world wide, the most widely accepted strategy is Demand-Response management. In this strategy, the customers or end-users are incentivized to change their energy-utility behavior with time in response to fluid price changes or to induce lower energy consumption during peak demand time. The system is controlled by a cloud of servers that monitor the demand- supply chain over a network all the time. This brings up the issue of security within the operations of the system.

Sliding window is used to obtain point cloud datasets from a multidimensional time series (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple). We apply persistent homology to quantify transient loops that appear in multiscale topological spaces, which associated on each point cloud dataset and encode the quantified information in a persistence landscape. Temporal changes in persistence landscapes are measured via their L1-norms. Consequently, a new representative is attained, called L1-norms time series. The L1-norms is associated with indicators: autocorrelation function at lag 1, variance and mean power spectrum at low frequencies to detect the signals. By using Kendall's tau correlation and significance test, significant rising trend events that occur before major financial crashes in Bitcoin are defined as the signals. A threshold is determined to scan entire data and record all the significant rising trend events. Lastly, we compare L1-norms with residuals time series, which is another representative obtained from de-trending approach. Our result portrays that autocorrelation function at lag 1 and variance of the L1-norms successfully detect early warning signals before the 2017 and 2019 major financial crashes. However, variance of the L1-norms is better since it able to signal another 2018 major financial crash. For the residuals, no early warning signals are detected. Hence, persistent homology provides a better representative than de-trending approach. Overall, persistent homology is a promising method to detect early warning signals of major financial crashes in Bitcoin."

This objective requires to specify whether investors can extend their exposure in certain asset classes and benefit their portfolios in a statistically significant way. In this paper, we address this issue of diversification in the context of cryptoasset portfolios and examine whether their risk-adjusted performance can be enhanced through seeking exposure into the commodities class. For an equally-weighted portfolio of five cryptoassets, we first consider the addition of physical gold, as conceptualised by the CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index, a diversified, monthly-rebalanced index that seeks exposure to both asset classes. We further consider modifying the index composition by replacing physical gold with a basket of five commodities. Mean-variance spanning tests reveal that the addition of physical gold in the original cryptoasset portfolio translates to a significant shift in the efficient frontier, both in terms of the global minimum variance and the tangency portfolios. Additionally, expanding the exposure in the commodity side confirms a statistically significant improvement, with the diversification benefit arising from a shift in the tangency portfolio. We further generate a number of price paths for the original index, the modified index and their components, according to a Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH specification, to assess the efficiency of the index weighted risk contribution scheme. Results demonstrate a superior performance of the two indices when compared against their constituents in terms of Omega ratio.

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation. Further, to check the usability of DL-GuesS on other cryptocurrencies, we have also inferred results for price prediction of Bitcoin-Cash with the price history and tweets of Bitcoin-Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin. © 2013 IEEE."
do candlestick patterns work in cryptocurrency trading?,"ho, kh; chan, tt; pan, h; li, c",2021 ieee international conference on big data (big data),2021,10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671826,,0,Conference,CORE - B,"This paper investigates the effectiveness of candlestick patterns in cryptocurrency trading. Our data set includes historical daily opening, high, low, and closing prices of the top 23 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. We examine 68 commonly used candlestick patterns using statistical analysis and find that the studied candlestick patterns are of little use in cryptocurrency trading. On the contrary, there are more patterns with relatively low accuracy. Investors should be cautious with their trading strategies and decisions when these patterns appear, as they may be a false trading signal that could cause losses rather than gains. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first research studies to investigate the effectiveness of candlestick patterns in cryptocurrency trading. Our findings could serve as a reference for investors when developing cryptocurrency trading strategies."
do cryptocurrency prices camouflage latent economic effects? a bayesian hidden markov approach,"koki c., leonardos s., piliouras g.",future internet,2020,10.3390/fi12030059,bayesian modeling; bitcoin; cryptocurrencies; ethereum; forecasting; logistic regression; non-homogeneous hidden markov models; variables selection,1,Journal,Q2,"We study the Bitcoin and Ether price series under a financial perspective. Specifically, we use two econometric models to perform a two-layer analysis to study the correlation and prediction of Bitcoin and Ether price series with traditional assets. In the first part of this study, we model the probability of positive returns via a Bayesian logistic model. Even though the fitting performance of the logistic model is poor, we find that traditional assets can explain some of the variability of the price returns. Along with the fact that standard models fail to capture the statistic and econometric attributes-such as extreme variability and heteroskedasticity-of cryptocurrencies, this motivates us to apply a novel Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov model to these series. In particular, we model Bitcoin and Ether prices via the non-homogeneous Polya-Gamma Hidden Markov (NHPG) model, since it has been shown that it outperforms its counterparts in conventional financial data. The transition probabilities of the underlying hidden process are modeled via a logistic link whereas the observed series follow a mixture of normal regressions conditionally on the hidden process. Our results show that the NHPG algorithm has good in-sample performance and captures the heteroskedasticity of both series. It identifies frequent changes between the two states of the underlying Markov process. In what constitutes the most important implication of our study, we show that there exist linear correlations between the covariates and the ETH and BTC series. However, only the ETH series are affected non-linearly by a subset of the accounted covariates. Finally, we conclude that the large number of significant predictors along with the weak degree of predictability performance of the algorithm back up earlier findings that cryptocurrencies are unlike any other financial assets and predicting the cryptocurrency price series is still a challenging task. These findings can be useful to investors, policy makers, traders for portfolio allocation, risk management and trading strategies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Aiming at this problem, a model based on machine learning to detect smart grid DoS attacks has been proposed. The model first collects network data, secondly selects features and uses PCA for data dimensionality reduction, and finally uses SVM algorithm for abnormality detection.

However, since financial datasets have very low signal-to-noise ratio and are non-stationary, complex models are often very prone to overfitting and suffer from instability issues. Moreover, as various machine learning and data mining tools become more widely used in quantitative trading, many trading firms have been producing an increasing number of features (aka factors). Therefore, how to automatically select effective features becomes an imminent problem. To address these issues, we propose DoubleEnsemble, an ensemble framework leveraging learning trajectory based sample reweighting and shuffling based feature selection. Specifically, we identify the key samples based on the training dynamics on each sample and elicit key features based on the ablation impact of each feature via shuffling. Our model is applicable to a wide range of base models, capable of extracting complex patterns, while mitigating the overfitting and instability issues for financial market prediction. We conduct extensive experiments, including price prediction for cryptocurrencies and stock trading, using both DNN and gradient boosting decision tree as base models. Our experiment results demonstrate that DoubleEnsemble achieves a superior performance compared with several baseline methods."

However, some celebrities have gone as far as affixing their celebrity to a specific cryptocurrency, becoming a crypto-tastemaker. One such example occurred in April 2021 when Elon Musk claimed via Twitter that “SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon”. He later called himself the “Dogefather” as he announced that he would be hosting Saturday Night Live (SNL) on 8 May 2021. By performing sentiment analysis on relevant tweets during the time he was hosting SNL, evidence is found that negative perceptions of Musk’s performance led to a decline in the price of Dogecoin, which dropped 23.4% during the time Musk was on air.

A legitimate file in a whitelist may be represented by its cryptographic hash, such as a hash generated using an SHA1 or MD5 hash function. Due to the fact that any small change to a file in a cryptographic hash results in a completely different hash, a file with a cryptographic hash in a whitelist may no longer be identifiable in the whitelist if the file is modified even by a small amount. This prevents a target file from being identified as legitimate even if the target file is simply a new version of a whitelisted legitimate file. Locality Sensitive Hashing is a state of the art method in big data and machine learning for the scalable application of approximate nearest neighbor search in high dimensional spaces [9]. The identification of executable files which are very similar to known legitimate executable files fits very well within this paradigm. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of applying TLSH [1,2]; Trend Micro's implementation of locality sensitive hashing, to identify files similar to legitimate executable files. We start with a brief explanation of locality sensitive hashing and TLSH. We then proceed with the concept of whitelisting, and describe typical modifications made to legitimate executable files such as security updates, patches, functionality enhancements, and corrupted files. We will also describe the scalability problems posed by all the legitimate executable files available on the Windows OS. We will also show results of similarity testing against malicious files (malwares). Data will be provided on the efficacy and scalability of this approach. We will conclude with a discussion of how this new methodology may be employed in a variety of computer security applications to improve the functionality and operation of a computer system. Examples may include whitelisting, overriding malware detection performed by a machine learning system, identifying corrupted legitimate files, and identifying new versions of legitimate files."

The results across different time scales are tested for noise using permutation entropy technique, empirical estimations are represented in statistical complexity plane to show the structure of efficiency links. Usage of AMIM in short window estimation is justified. Efficiency levels seem to be closely connected if judged from the standpoint of information theory at all time frames.

Although the future of WSNs is very prospective, the security issues become more and more important because they are used for very critical applications in engineering areas. Furthermore, they are very vulnerable and thus attractive to attacks because of human-unattended deployment and their limited prices. Generally, they are protected by public key cryptosystems. Such systems depends on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithms or integer factorizations. However, they can be attacked by Shor's algorithm on quantum computers. Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC) schemes are secure to attacks by quantum computers. Among such schemes, multivariate signatures use various multiplications in a finite field, which are time-consuming operations during signature generations. Thus, we focus on improving multiplications in finite fields for multivariate signatures. We propose a variant of Mastrovito multiplications based on trinomial, Special Trinomial (ST), pentanomial, Special Pentanomial (SP), Equally-spaced-polynomial (ESP), All-One-polynomial (AOP), and successive-one-polynomial (SOP).

However, fraudulent consumers launch electricity theft cyber attacks by reporting false readings to reduce their bills illegally. These attacks do not only cause financial losses but may also degrade the grid performance because the readings are used for grid management. To identify these attackers, the existing schemes employ machine-learning models using the consumers fine-grained readings, which violates the consumers privacy by revealing their lifestyle. In this article, we propose an efficient scheme that enables the SO to detect electricity theft, compute bills, and monitor load while preserving the consumers privacy. The idea is that SMs encrypt their readings using functional encryption (FE), and the SO uses the ciphertexts to: 1) compute the bills following the dynamic pricing approach; 2) monitor the grid load; and 3) evaluate a machine-learning model to detect fraudulent consumers, without being able to learn the individual readings to preserve consumers privacy. We adapted an FE scheme so that the encrypted readings are aggregated for billing and load monitoring and only the aggregated value is revealed to the SO. Also, we exploited the inner-product operations on encrypted readings to evaluate a machine-learning model to detect fraudulent consumers. The real data set is used to evaluate our scheme, and our evaluations indicate that our scheme is secure and can detect fraudulent consumers accurately with low communication and computation overhead."

Although traditionally trading was done by professionals, nowadays a majority of market participants are market-data processing bots due to their inherent advantages in processing large amounts of data, lack of emotions of fear or greed, and predicting market prices through artificial intelligence. A large number of approaches have been brought forward to tackle this task, many of which rely on specially engineered deep learning methods with a focus on specific market conditions. The general limitation of these approaches, however, is the reliance on customized gradient-based methods which limit the scope of possible solutions and don't necessarily generalize well when solving similar problems. This paper proposes a method which uses neuroevolutionary techniques capable of automatically customizing offspring neural networks, generating entire populations of solutions and more thoroughly exploring and parallelizing potential solutions. Our approach uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve increasingly improved populations of neural networks which, based on sentimental and technical analysis data, efficiently predict future market price movements. The effectiveness of this approach is validated by testing the system on both live and historical trading scenarios, and its robustness is tested on other cryptocurrency and stock markets. Experimental results during a 30-day live-trading period show that this method outperformed the buy and hold strategy by over 260%, even while factoring in standard trading fees. © 2021 ACM."

Recent advances in deep learning have enabled not only the classification of encrypted transits, but classification on a per-packet level. End-to-end deep learning models are becoming increasingly ubiq-uitous given their ease of use, i.e., developers do not need to engineer features, and their apparent versatility. However, deep learning entails black-box models that hinder the capability to debug and explain classifications. Moreover, the computational complexity of deep learning can incur unnecessary latency, which is problematic for real-time classification needs. In this paper, we propose a methodology to interpret black-box, deep learning-based encrypted network traffic classification models, with an attempt to understand the dominant features a classifier is focusing on for a given task. We evaluate our approach on state-of-the-art deep learning classification techniques for encrypted per-packet classification and demonstrate how interpretability can be used to debug and improve the training pipeline while significantly reducing the size of the deep learning model.

Traffic profiles are constructed by machine-learning (ML) algorithms using the series of packet sizes and arrival times of QUIC connections. Thus, the proposed QoS method does not require explicit setup of a path (i.e. it provides soft QoS), but employs agents within the network to verify that flows conform to a given traffic profile.

Although substantial deep learning methods have been proposed to detect such attacks, deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which modify input of DNNs with unnoticeable but malicious perturbations. This article proposes a method to explore targeted and stealthy FDIAs via adversarial machine learning. We pose FDIAs as sparse optimization problems to achieve initial attack objectives and remain stealthy during attacks. We propose a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the problems and explore additional sparse-state attacks. The experimental results show that for IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems, the success rate of two-state sparse attacks with small-scale targets is as high as 80%. In addition, the attack success rate can continue to increase as the number of attack states increases. The proposed attacks demonstrate that attackers can implement attacks that can bypass both bad data detectors and neural network detectors while keeping the initial attack objectives unchanged, which is a critical and urgent security threat in CPS."
exploring the influence of news articles on bitcoin price with machine learning,"yao w., xu k., li q.",proceedings - ieee symposium on computers and communications,2019,10.1109/ISCC47284.2019.8969596,bitcoin price trends; machine learning; text mining,4,Conference,CORE - B,"In recent years, cryptocurrencies have become more and more popular around the world, and they are being accepted and used by more countries. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, and they form an emerging market that is different from stocks. At present, there is already much work around the stock price prediction using news articles, but there are few papers on the cryptocurrency market. In this paper, we aim to research the effects of news articles on bitcoin prices. We extract features from news articles with both commonly used text feature extraction algorithms (e.g., N-Gram and TF-IDF) and SentiGraph, which is a novel text representation method we propose. SentiGraph takes advantages of sentiment analysis and transforms a news article into a graph. Compared with previous feature extraction methods, our experiment results show that this new approach is superior on the prediction accuracy, which also demonstrates the impacts of news articles on the bitcoin price. © 2019 IEEE."

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government agencies resulting in prices being strongly influenced by public opinion. Understanding the relationship between cryptocurrency prices and the public sentiment can lead to improved predictions of price movement. In this paper, we give an exploratory analysis of a network of 24 Reddit communities related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies to analyze Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements. We engineer a set of 112 time series features from submissions and comments made on the selected subreddits, run Granger causality tests on engineered time series against cryptocurrency price movements, and use these time series to forecast the cryptocurrency price movements using classification models. Results from these models support the Granger causality test results showing that with only lagged price values and lagged values from a single Reddit data derived feature, the direction of Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements can be predicted with 74.2% and 73.1% accuracy respectively. © 2019 IEEE."

fastshare: scalable secret sharing by leveraging locality,"kadhe, s; rajaraman, n; ramchandran, k",2021 ieee international symposium on information theory (isit),2021,10.1109/ISIT45174.2021.9518282,,0,Conference,CORE - B,"Shamir's secret sharing scheme is widely used in many cryptographic protocols such as secure multi-party computation. It allows a secret to be distributed to n parties such that any t parties learn no information about the secret, whereas any t +1 parties can recover the secret. However, the worst-case recovery guarantees come at the price of O(n(2)) computation cost. This quadratic cost limits its scalability to applications involving only a small number of participants. This paper presents a framework, called FastShare, for designing secret sharing schemes that ensures worst-case security guarantees at a lower computation cost by relaxing the recovery constraint from worst-case to average-case in a statistical sense. In particular, FastShare considers the setup where each party takes part in the recovery process with some probability rho, independently of others. The core idea of FastShare is to construct a 'signal' using the secret and random masks by inserting zeros at judiciously chosen locations, and take its finite field fast Fourier transform (FFT) to generate the shares. We present a scheme designed using FastShare where the judicious zero placement ensures that the shares form a codeword of a locally recoverable code. The locality property along with the FFT allows us to recover the secret with O(n log n) computational complexity, from a 'random' subset of shares of large enough size. We analyze its security and recovery thresholds, and characterize a trade-off between p and the probability of successfully recovering the secret. Further, we carry out numerical simulations to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme for a wide range of values of n."

As a consequence, one of the WSN-related security tasks is to protect them from Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. Machine learning-based systems are the only viable option for these types of attacks, as traditional packet deep scan systems depend on open field inspection in transport layer security packets and the open field encryption trend. Moreover, network data traffic will become more complex due to increases in the amount of data transmitted between WSN nodes as a result of increasing usage in the future. Therefore, there is a need to use feature selection techniques with machine learning in order to determine which data in the DoS detection process are most important. This paper examined techniques for improving DoS anomalies detection along with power reservation in WSNs to balance them. A new clustering technique was introduced, called the CH_Rotations algorithm, to improve anomaly detection efficiency over a WSN’s lifetime. Furthermore, the use of feature selection techniques with machine learning algorithms in examining WSN node traffic and the effect of these techniques on the lifetime of WSNs was evaluated. The evaluation results showed that the Water Cycle (WC) feature selection displayed the best average performance accuracy of 2%, 5%, 3%, and 3% greater than Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Harmony Search (HS), and Genetic Algorithm (GA), respectively. Moreover, the WC with Decision Tree (DT) classifier showed 100% accuracy with only one feature. In addition, the CH_Rotations algorithm improved network lifetime by 30% compared to the standard LEACH protocol. Network lifetime using the WC + DT technique was reduced by 5% compared to other WC + DT-free scenarios. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In this paper, we address the problem of real-time QoE monitoring of HAS, focusing on the detection of re-buffering events and QoE-relevant metrics, for the particular case of YouTube. Given the wide adoption of end-to-end encryption, we resort to machine learning models to predict these metrics directly from the analysis of the encrypted traffic. The salient feature of our approach ViCrypt is its ability to perform QoE predictions in real-time, during the course of an ongoing YouTube streaming session, relying on constant memory, stream-like inputs continuously extracted from the encrypted stream of packets. We show through empirical evaluations that ViCrypt can predict the occurrence of re-buffering events with a time granularity as small as one second with very high accuracy. By aggregating independent predictions, ViCrypt is able to accurately estimate per-video-session QoE-relevant metrics such as initial playback delay, number of re-buffering events and stalling ratio. In this situation, we investigate if a decent prediction performance can also be reached by selecting reduced feature sets based on the relevance of the features. Moreover, we explore the potential of including recurrent features, namely, stalling predictions from past time slots, to improve the prediction performance. © 2019 IEEE."

Cryptocurrencies price behaviour is still largely unexplored, presenting new opportunities for researchers and economists to highlight similarities and differences with standard financial prices. We compared our results with various benchmarks: one recent work on Bitcoin prices forecasting that follows different approaches, a well-known paper that uses Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily NASDAQ closing prices spanning a 3-year interval and another, more recent paper which gives quantitative results on stock market index predictions. We followed different approaches in parallel, implementing both statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms: the Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model for uni-variate series forecast using only closing prices, and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for multivariate series using both price and volume data. We used two artificial neural networks as well: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). While the entire time series resulted to be indistinguishable from a random walk, the partitioning of datasets into shorter sequences, representing different price ""regimes"", allows to obtain precise forecast as evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) and relative Root Mean Square Error (relativeRMSE). In this case the best results are obtained using more than one previous price, thus confirming the existence of time regimes different from random walks.

We term the instances of extreme Bitcoin movement as ‘spikes’. In this paper, spikes are defined as the returns instances that outreach a two-standard deviations band around the mean value. Instead of the unconditional historic standard deviation that is usually used, in this paper, we utilized a GARCH(p,q) model to derive the conditional standard deviation. We claim that the conditional standard deviation is a more suitable measure of on-the-spot risk than the overall standard deviation.

The proposed framework considers tweets that mention the cryptocurrency Dogecoin and analyses the textual content of each of these tweets using a modified version of the lexicon-based sentiment polarity analysis method, VADER. The generated, Twitter sentiment time series is then compared to a time series of the closing prices of Dogecoin for each day. Granger causality analysis showed a unidirectional relationship between Twitter sentiment and cryptocurrency prices for day lags ranging from 2 to 4 days (with a 3-day lag having the lowest statistical significance value). This was also accompanied by a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.6940 and a clear visual correlation between the two time series (with this 3-day lag). Findings indicate that Twitter sentiment is directly correlated and can be predictive of the future prices of cryptocurrencies."

A common limitation of recent fuzzy time series models is their inability to handle non-stationary data. Thus, in this paper we introduce a Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series (NSFTS). In the proposed method, we employ Non-Stationary Fuzzy Sets, in which perturbation functions are used to adapt the membership function parameters in the knowledge base in response to statistical changes in the time series. The flexibility of the method by means of computational experiments was tested with eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several kinds of concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ SP500 and TAIEX), three real FOREX pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, GBP-USD), and two real cryptocoins exchange rates (Bitcoin-USD and Ethereum-USD). As competitor models the Time Variant fuzzy time series and the Incremental Ensemble were used, these are two of the major approaches for handling non-stationary data sets. The proposed method shows resilience to concept drift, by adapting parameters of the model, while preserving the symbolic structure of the knowledge base. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

In this kind of networks, not only nonsensitive data exchange is performed, but also sensitive data (digital signatures, login credentials, account numbers, personal images, and so on) are shared. Therefore, new appropriate approaches to encrypt the secret information are highly required. This paper presents an experimental setup of a fractional-chaos based-cryptosystem for ad hoc networks under the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The proposed cryptosystem is composed of a novel chaotic pairing approach between the coordinator node and end-devices nodes to sending data into the network. More specifically, the RF-data of the IEEE 802.15.4 frame is encrypted using a fractional-order encryption key and four iterative steps. It is worth to note that the chaotic key is based on a fractional-order chaotic system, which is derived from the fractional calculus theory. Fractional-order chaotic dynamics are demonstrated using the Lyapunov method and equilibria stability. Next, the experimental validation of the cryptosystem is shown sending an encrypted image between ARM digital platforms and wireless Xbee modules. Several security analyses indicate the proposed encryption scheme has suitable statistical properties, sizeable keyspace, and high sensitivity providing secure communications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to IoT devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like IoT applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term IoT device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat.

Since their initiation, the prices seem highly volatile and came to their amazing cutoff points during the COVID-19 pandemic. This factor makes them a popular choice for investors with an aim to get higher returns over a short span of time. The colossal high points and low points in digital forms of money costs have drawn in analysts from the scholarly community as well as ventures to foresee their costs. A few machines and deep learning algorithms like gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX), and a lot more have been utilized to exactly predict and investigate the elements influencing cryptocurrency prices. The current literature is totally centered around the forecast of digital money costs disregarding its reliance on other cryptographic forms of money. However, Dash coin is an individual cryptocurrency, but it is derived from Bitcoin and Litecoin. The change in Bitcoin and Litecoin prices affects the Dash coin price. Motivated from these, we present a cryptocurrency price prediction framework in this paper. It acknowledges different cryptographic forms of money (which are subject to one another) as information and yields higher accuracy. To illustrate this concept, we have considered a price prediction of Dash coin through the past days' prices of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin as they have hierarchical dependency among them at the protocol level. We can portray the outcomes that the proposed scheme predicts the prices with low misfortune and high precision. The model can be applied to different digital money cost expectations. © 2013 IEEE."

With the disruption of Bitcoin as a new model which relies on decentralisation and anonymity, attackers have taken advantage of this monetary system. It allows them to obtain funds from illegal activities such as ransomware payments and hide them. At the same time, Law Enforcement Agencies use open-source data to apply network forensics to Blockchain data. The analysis is usually performed by using artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the current situation shows a scarcity of high-quality data sets to train the detection algorithms. This work tries to overcome this barrier with significant contributions. With nearly 25,000 illicit transactions, we have increased the Elliptic Data Set -the most extensive labelled transaction data publicly available in any cryptocurrency. The former data set only contained 4,545 illicit transactions, resulting in a class imbalance of 9.8:90.2 illicit/licit ratio. Our work has changed that to a 41.2:58.8 illicit/licit ratio. Besides, to show that class imbalance datasets can also be beaten with artificial work, we have studied the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for creating synthetic samples. Finally, the last part of this work was dedicated to applying deep learning and, more particularly, long short-term memory networks (LSTM) for the binary classification problem. We show ideal results that can help change the current state-of-the-art trend, mainly focused on machine learning algorithms."

Among all security threats, the hardware trojan (HT) inserted into the integrated circuit is one of the most concerns. As a flexible and nondestructive approach, the side-channel analysis techniques are widely used for HT detection. However, noise sensitivity and golden chip dependence make side-channel based approaches face greatly challenge in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel HT detection approach based on Isolation Forest, which provides high precision detection capability, while reducing the dependence of the golden chip. First, we perform special preprocessing, named Main Difference Accumulation (MDA), on the side-channel information to magnify the impacts of HT. Then, we train the isolation forest model using the processed information. During the test phase, the obtained model can score the test data. Finally, we complete the detection of HT based on the score and threshold. Moreover, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to achieve the automatic selection of the threshold in the isolation forest. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, we select the power signal as the side-channel information and insert four different kinds of HTs into the AES-128 crypto core. Results obtained using a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA board show that the accuracy of HT detection can reach 100%, with a 1.13% relative area ratio of the original circuit. © 2020 IEEE."
hedging with automatic liquidation and leverage selection on bitcoin futures,"alexander c., deng j., zou b.",european journal of operational research,2023,10.1016/j.ejor.2022.07.037,cryptocurrency; finance; leverage; liquidation; perpetual swap,0,Journal,Q1,"Bitcoin derivatives positions are maintained with a self-selected margin, which is often too low to avoid automatic liquidation by the exchange, without notice, especially during periods of excessive volatility. Indeed, according to CryptoQuant, almost $80 billion of positions on centralised exchanges were liquidated during 2021, that is an average of over $200 million per day. So hedgers of bitcoin price risk should account for the possibility of automatic liquidation when taking positions on bitcoin futures. We derive a semi-closed form for an optimal hedging strategy with dual objectives – to minimize both the variance of the hedged portfolio and the probability of liquidation due to insufficient collateral. The solution depends on the statistical characteristics of the spot and futures extreme returns, and other parameters that characterize the hedger by choice of leverage, loss aversion and collateral management.

heterogeneous defect prediction based on federated reinforcement learning via gradient clustering,"wang a., zhao y., li g., zhang j., wu h., iwahori y.",ieee access,2022,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3195039,data island; experience replay; federated reinforcement learning; gaussian differential privacy,0,Journal,Q1,"Heterogeneous defect prediction (HDP) refers to using heterogeneous data collected by other projects to build a defect prediction model to predict the software defects in a project. Traditional methods usually involve the measurement of the source project and the target project. However, due to the limitations of laws and regulations, these original data are not easy to obtain, which forms a data island. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) has great advantages in training heterogeneous data and data island. In order to solve the data island and data heterogeneity of HDP, we propose a novel Federated Reinforcement Learning via Gradient Clustering (FRLGC) method in this paper. Firstly, the parameters of the global model are transferred to each dueling deep Q network (dueling DQN) model and each client uses private data to train the dueling model which combines experience replay to increase data efficiency in limited datasets. Secondly, gaussian differential privacy is used to encrypt the model parameters to ensure the privacy and security of the model. Finally, we cluster the clients according to their locally encrypted model parameters and use weighted average to aggregate to create a new global model locally and globally. Experiments on nine projects in three public databases (Relink, NASA and AEEEM) show that FRLGC is superior to the relevant HDP solutions. © 2013 IEEE."
high-efficiency min-entropy estimation based on neural network for random number generators,"lv, n; chen, ty; zhu, sy; yang, j; ma, y; jing, jw; lin, jq",security and communication networks,2020,10.1155/2020/4241713,,3,Journal,Q2,"Random number generator (RNG) is a fundamental and important cryptographic element, which has made an outstanding contribution to guaranteeing the network and communication security of cryptographic applications in the Internet age. In reality, if the random number used cannot provide sufficient randomness (unpredictability) as expected, these cryptographic applications are vulnerable to security threats and cause system crashes. Min-entropy is one of the approaches that are usually employed to quantify the unpredictability. The NIST Special Publication 800-90B adopts the concept of min-entropy in the design of its statistical entropy estimation methods, and the predictive model-based estimators added in the second draft of this standard effectively improve the overall capability of the test suite. However, these predictors have problems on limited application scope and high computational complexity, e.g., they have shortfalls in evaluating random numbers with long dependence and multivariate due to the huge time complexity (i.e., high-order polynomial time complexity). Fortunately, there has been increasing attention to using neural networks to model and forecast time series, and random numbers are also a type of time series. In our work, we propose several new and efficient approaches for min-entropy estimation by using neural network technologies and design a novel execution strategy for the proposed entropy estimation to make it applicable to the validation of both stationary and nonstationary sources. Compared with the 90B's predictors officially published in 2018, the experimental results on various simulated and real-world data sources demonstrate that our predictors have a better performance on the accuracy, scope of applicability, and execution efficiency. The average execution efficiency of our predictors can be up to 10 times higher than that of the 90B's for 106 sample size with different sample spaces. Furthermore, when the sample space is over 22 and the sample size is over 108, the 90B's predictors cannot give estimated results. Instead, our predictors can still provide accurate results.

Because of its digital nature, Bitcoin cannot be valuated exclusively with fundamental approaches, which is why factors such as investor sentiment have become a common alternative to capture its performance. In this work, we studied whether and how the sale of Bitcoins from the insolvency assets of Mt.Gox, which represent about 1.1% of the current global total, relates to Bitcoin price movements. We used social media sentiment analysis of Twitter data to examine how investors are influenced in their decision to buy or sell Bitcoin when confronted with the trade actions of Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee in charge of the Mt.Gox case. We built a vector error correction model to analyse the long-run relationship between cointegrated variables. Our analysis confirms the positive association of Bitcoin performance with positive Twitter sentiment and tweet volume and the negative association with negative sentiment. We further found empirical evidence that Mt.Gox selloff events have a lasting negative impact on the Bitcoin price and that we can measure this effect by Twitter sentiment and tweet volume. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

Following this trend, this work presents a novel implementation of a High-performance Polynomial Multiplication hardware Accelerator for NTRU (HPMA-NTRU) under different parameter settings, one of the lattice-based PQC algorithm that is currently under the consideration by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization process. In total, we have carried out three layers of efforts to obtain the proposed work. First of all, we have proposed a new schoolbook algorithm based strategy to derive the desired polynomial multiplication algorithm for NTRU. Then, we have mapped the algorithm to build a high-performance polynomial multiplication hardware accelerator and have extended this hardware accelerator to different parameter settings with proper adjustment. Finally, through a series of complexity analysis and implementation based comparison, we have shown that the proposed hardware accelerator obtains better area-time complexities than the state-of-the-art one. The outcome of this work is important and will impact the ongoing NIST PQC standardization process and can be deployed further to construct efficient NTRU cryptoprocessors."

With the evolving technological advancements in our day to day life security of personal data is a primary concern for all. Many intruders and hackers are eagerly waiting for personal data of the people which can be used in various means for their works. They always have an eye on the personal information of the people. And the second issue is that diagnosing of diabetes by the doctor will be some time prone to mistakes because it is natural that human makes mistakes but not the machines. So to overcome this issue we develop a hybrid secure algorithm which encrypts the patient personal information which they wish not to share to anyone outside the hospital by crypto AES encryption and hashing using SHA-256 and then storing the data in database which will be accessible only to the patient and the doctor. Together with encryption of the patient personal data and medical data our proposed system will effectively evaluate the data by a trained machine learning model to check whether a person is actually suffering from diabetes or not. We use logistic regression for evaluating the patient medical data to predict the health status so mistakes can be avoided in prediction as the prediction is done by the trained machine. Then doctor can give the treatment depending on the health status. As a result this system will give a sustainable solution to people for safely transmitting their personal data as well as medical data through wireless medium along with diabetes disease prediction. © 2022 IEEE.

In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem. © 2021 The Authors.

Thus, for the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), it has become more difficult to monitor and improve user QoE when users are watching videos or using other video application services. To overcome the above problem, a Cross-layer Predicting framework of Video Streaming QoE (CPVS) is proposed to monitor and predict video indicators that affect user QoE, such as startup delay, stalling rate and stalling events. The most prominent advantage of the CPVS is that it can predict the video QoE indicators without the prior information of transmission protocols, whether it is encrypted or not. Furthermore, the general framework, CPVS, shows high predicting accuracy both in a time granularity as small as one second and in video-session prediction, even can perform well with only 6 features. For the session-based prediction, the best weighted f1 score achieves 85.71% about the startup delay prediction, and achieves 84.64% about the stalling rate classification. For the real-time prediction, the best weighted f1 score can achieve 79.25%. Besides, by exploring the 4G network features, we find out the 6 most critical ones that not only make the CPVS retain high accuracy but also save 35.02% running time to improve the real-time prediction performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

improving the cryptocurrency price prediction performance based on reinforcement learning,"shahbazi z., byun y.-c.",ieee access,2021,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3133937,cryptocurrency; machine learning; price prediction; reinforcement learning,10,Journal,Q1,"During recent developments, cryptocurrency has become a famous key factor in financial and business opportunities. However, the cryptocurrency investment is not visible regarding the market’s inconsistent aspect and volatility of high prices. Due to the real-time prediction of prices, the previous approaches in price prediction doesn’t contain enough information and solution for forecasting the price changes. Based on the mentioned problems in cryptocurrency price prediction, we proposed a machine learning-based approach to price prediction for a financial institution.

inferring quality of experience for adaptive video streaming over https and quic,"tisa-selma, bentaleb a., harous s.","2020 international wireless communications and mobile computing, iwcmc 2020",2020,10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148208,classification accuracy; encrypted video traffic; http adaptive streaming; inferring qoe; machine learning; qoe; random forest,4,Conference,CORE - B,"Nowadays, Internet traffic encryption is rapidly increasing due to privacy and security concerns. This is because of the massive usage of end-to-end security protocols over Internet such as HTTPS and QUIC. The encryption trend will continue to rapidly increase in the future, and this trend concerns video streaming applications as well. Network providers face a serious challenge in managing their networks due to such widespread deployment of end-to-end security protocols. These operators need to have a clear visibility into traffic on their networks to monitor and manage both quality of experience (QoE)-and-service (QoS) impairments in popular video streaming services, in the most effective and efficient manner. Moreover, so many factors that influence QoE need to be taken care of to get an acceptable user experience. Most of the existing solutions use the deep packet inspection to infer these factors from the encrypted traffic. However, these solutions are inefficient, most of the time, leading to low QoE inference accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine-learning based solution that leverages a random forest classifier for a better QoE inference accuracy. The proposed solution uses network-and-transport layer information to infer QoE factors such as startup delay and stall events. It helps the network providers to react quickly and in real time for any impairments in the QoE of the encrypted video traffic. We evaluate our solution using an HTTP adaptive streaming service (YouTube) that uses HTTPS and QUIC protocols. Our experimental results show that our solution achieves up to 91.1% classification accuracy for HTTPS and up to 87.3% for QUIC. © 2020 IEEE."
information availability and return volatility in the bitcoin market: analyzing differences of user opinion and interest,"yu j.h., kang j., park s.",information processing and management,2019,10.1016/j.ipm.2018.12.002,bitcoin; cryptocurrency; gjr-garch; market efficiency; trading volume; user differences of opinion; user interest; volatility,37,Journal,Q1,"We study returns volatility and information availability in the rapidly growing Bitcoin market. The market microstructure for bitcoins is highly developed in terms of information generation and transfer. Therefore, returns volatility is highly likely to be affected by market information availability. We analyze the relationship between returns volatility and two independent variables, user opinion difference and user interest. This study adopted the GJR-GARCH model, appropriate for volatility studies. First, we find that, for volatility asymmetry, the Bitcoin market exhibits greater market efficiency than the general financial market. Also, the persistence of volatility is greater. The Bitcoin market is still relatively unregulated; hence, studying the relationship between information asymmetry and regulation in the market is salient. Moreover, we can infer that the ratio of reasonable users is high in the Bitcoin market. Second, the Bitcoin market supports the sequential information arrival hypothesis in that day trading volume, which is a proxy for user differences of opinion, has a statistically significant effect on returns volatility. Third, for the proxies of user interest, namely, the growth rate of page views on Google Trends and Wikipedia, only the growth rate of Google Trends shows statistically significant effects on Bitcoin returns volatility. This study can provide useful information to the financial market and policy makers on the behavior of the Bitcoin market, which may help to lower future entry barriers and opportunity costs of the Bitcoin market. © 2018"

However, although federated learning uses encrypted security aggregation, its decentralised nature makes it vulnerable to malicious attackers. A deliberate attacker can subtly control one or more participants and upload malicious model parameter updates, but the aggregation server cannot detect it due to encrypted privacy protection. Based on these problems, we find a practical and novel security risk in the design of federal learning. We propose an attack for conspired malicious participants to adjust the training data strategically so that the weight of a certain dimension in the aggregation model will rise or fall with a pattern. The trend of weights or parameters in the aggregation model forms meaningful signals, which is the risk of information leakage. The leakage is exposed to other participants in this federation but only available for participants who reach an agreement with the malicious participant, i.e., the receiver must be able to understand patterns of changes in weights.

The Debian project has solved this need by using what we termed a curated Web of Trust. We will explain some lessons learned from a massive key migration process that was triggered in 2014. We will present the social insight we have found from examining the relationships expressed as signatures in this curated Web of Trust, as well as a statistical study and forecast on aging, refreshment and survival of project participants stemming from an analysis on their key's activity within the keyring."

With an aggressive design strategy exploiting the extremely simple and low-degree S-box and low number of rounds, Pyjamask, the fundamental block cipher of the AEAD with the same name, has the smallest number of AND gates per bit among all the existing block ciphers (except Low-MC or Rasta which work on unconventional plaintext/key sizes). Thus, although the AEAD Pyjamask stuck at the second round of the NIST lightweight cryptography standardization process, the block cipher Pyjamask itself still attracts a lot of attention. Not very unexpectedly, the low degree and the low number of rounds are the biggest weakness of Pyjamask. At FSE 2020, Dobraunig et al. successfully mounted an algebraic and higher-order differential attack on full Pyjamask-96, one member of the Pyjamask block cipher family. However, the drawback of this attack is that it has to use the full codebook, which makes the attack less appealing. In this paper, we take integral attacks as our weapon, which are also sensitive to the low degree. Based on a new 11-round integral distinguishes found by state-of-the-art detection techniques, and combined with the relationship between round keys that reduces the involved keys, we give the key recovery attack on the full Pyjamask-96 without the full codebook for the first time. Further, the algebraic and higher-order differential technique does not work for Pyjamask-128, the other member of the Pyjamask block cipher family. To better understand the security margin of Pyjamask-128, we present the first third-party cryptanalysis on Pyjamask-128 up to 11 out of 14 rounds."

In addition, MHS consumes higher power and reported as one of the primary Voice of Customer (VoC) issue. Due to high power consumption, many customers are skeptical about MHS feature and its continuous usage. Apart from few literatures, there is no specific IEEE 802.11 standard for MHS and its power management. In this paper, we have proposed a Machine Learning (ML) based Intelligent MHS Power Save (I-MHSPS) algorithm using Wi-Fi parameters such as RSSI, SNR, TX power and channel condition. In addition, we have used other contextual parameters such as client behavior, battery level, application usage and internet backhaul to improve the accuracy of our algorithm. In I-MHSPS, we have proposed Intelligent Transmit Power Control (I-TPC): MHS TX power regulation based on client vicinity, Intelligent Ultra Power Save (I-UPS): Applying different system power level for MHS operation and Intelligent Low Power Encryption (I-LPE): Enabling low power encryption for short range MHS. In our first experiment with I-TPC idea has reduced power consumption by 10-16% approximately when compared to existing methodologies. In second experiment for I-UPS, we have applied different system power levels for MHS operation and achieved power saving around 22% without any performance degradation.

Finally, a reinforcement learning model is established based on artificial intelligence, and LSTM is used to extract data features and is combined with DQN algorithm to solve. Based on the CPMA model of problem one, we correlate this improved model with transaction costs. And conduct descriptive statistics on the relationship between yield rate and cost of revenue. It can be seen that the transaction cost adjustment has a large short-term impact on the market, and the long-term impact is relatively small. Therefore, we recommend reducing costs appropriately to improve profitability."

We validated our method on a dataset of 151 consecutive patients with detected PFO at a large grade A hospital in China from November 2018 to December 2020, we obtained an area under the relative operating characteristic curve of 0.816, with 65% specificity at 73% sensitivity. The RF models accurately represented the relationship between the CS and remotely sensed predictor variables. Therein, maximum mobility, large right-to-left shunt during Valsalva maneuver, size of PFO in diastole and systole, and diastolic length of the tunnel present higher predictive value in CS. Our findings suggest that multi-Doppler sensor data by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-detected morphologic and functional characteristics of PFO may play important roles in the occurrence of CS.

The lake cryptodepression, filled with 220 million m3 of fresh drinking water, represents a specific karst phenomenon. To better understand the impact of water level change drivers, the occurrence of meteorological and hydrological droughts was analysed. Basic machine learning methods (ML) such as the multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to simulate water levels. Modelling was carried out considering annual inputs of precipitation, air temperature, and abstraction rate as well as their influential lags which were determined by auto-correlation and cross-correlation techniques. Hydrological droughts have been recorded since 1986, and after 2006 a series of mostly mild hot to moderate hot years was recorded. All three ML models have been trained to recognize extreme conditions in the form of less precipitation, high abstraction rate, and, consequently, low water levels in the testing (predicting) period. The best statistical indicators were achieved with the MNLR model. The methodologies applied in the study were found to be useful tools for the analysis of changes in water levels. Extended monitoring of water balance elements should precede any future increase in the abstraction rate. © 2022 by the authors."

However, when cloud clients store their data in the cloud, the security and privacy of cloud data would be threatened due to accidental corruptions or purposive attacks caused by a semi-trusted cloud server. The widely used method of addressing the security and privacy of cloud data is to store encrypted data instead of plain data. As the resulting system is unusable, since the cloud can no longer search throughout the data, new cryptographic primitive such as public-key encryption with equality test (PKEET) has been introduced. PKEET has many interesting applications such as keyword search on encrypted data, encrypted data partitioning for efficient encrypted data management, personal health record systems, spam filtering in encrypted email systems and so forth. PKEET allows checking whether two ciphertexts encrypted under different public keys contain the same message or not. However, unrestricted access to equality tests can reveal information about the underlying data. This is not acceptable in respect of users' privacy. In 2015, Ma et al. introduce the notion of PKEET with flexible authorization (PKEET-FA) which strengthens privacy protection. Since 2015, there are several follow-up works on PKEET-FA.

TESAT's LCTs have successfully accomplished more than 25.000 links in the past six years. In this paper, an overview of the results generated during this time is presented. Eight LCTs 135, 1064 nm wavelength are/have been in operation in the past six years. Two LCTs are on board of geostationary satellites (GEOs) and six are/were on board of low-orbit satellites (LEOs) covering wide range of missions from earth observation (e.g. Copernicus program) and surveillance to technology demonstrator payloads (e.g. TDP1 Experimentation Program) [1] [2]. Space to ground links (SGLs) have been demonstrated using different art of optical ground stations (OGS). Upand down-optical links with and without communication between the Technology Demonstrator Payload 1 (TDP1) and the DLR Transportable Adaptive Optics Ground Station (T-AOGS) [12] have been used for experimental purpose, contributing to the data generation for atmospheric modelling and supporting the experts in building a better understanding of atmospheric impact onto the optical channel [3]. In order to implement and operate the LCTs, new operational concepts have been developed. Generation of operational products like link requests or commanding files has been supported and tuned [5] [2]. Further technology applications like airborne terminals are currently under validation. In 2019, several companies have started the verification of their terminals using the E2E test bed TDP1 and the T-AOGS described in [4]. Testing campaigns are ongoing in 2019. The TDP1 test bed has also supported quantum key distribution (QKD) verifications [7] [13] and optical channel characterization [9]. Methods for analysis, characterization and assessment of trends and performances of the LCTs in space and OGS have been developed and implemented. The Long Term Performance Analysis (LTPA) enables the assessment of potential degradations and allows for an introduction of corresponding counter measures (i.e. parameter settings modifications) preventing from negative impact on operations and services [6] [10].

Models trained via a Neural Network (NN) can offer accurate and efficient inference services for mobile users. Unfortunately, the current deployment of such service encounters privacy concerns. Directly offloading the model to the mobile device violates model privacy of the model owner, while feeding user input to the service compromises user privacy. To address this issue, we propose Leia, a lightweight cryptographic NN inference system at the edge. Leia is designed from two mobile-friendly perspectives. First, it leverages the paradigm of edge computing wherein the inference procedure keeps the model closer to the mobile user to foster low latency service. Specifically, Leia's architecture consists of two non-colluding edge services to obliviously perform NN inference on the encoded user data and model. Second, Leia's realization makes the judicious use of potentially constrained computational and communication resources in edge devices. We adapt the Binarized Neural Network (BNN), a trending flavor of NN with low inference overhead, and purely choose the lightweight secret sharing techniques to realize secure blocks of BNN. We implement Leia and deploy it on Raspberry Pi. Empirical evaluations on benchmark and medical datasets via various models demonstrate the practicality of Leia."

However, there are design challenges in UASNs, such as limited network lifetime and low communication reliability provoked by the constrained battery supply of sensors and harsh channel conditions in the underwater environments. To meet communication reliability requirements, packet-duplication and multi-path routing algorithms have been recommended in the literature. Furthermore, underwater sensors may convey sensitive data, which must be masked to avoid eavesdropping attempts. To improve network security, cryptographic encryption is the most widely used method. Nevertheless, data encryption needs computations to cipher the data, which consumes extra energy, resulting in a cutback in the life span of the network. To address these challenges, an optimization model has been proposed to evaluate the impacts of multi-path routing, packet duplication, encryption, and data fragmentation on the lifetime of the UASNs. However, the solution time of the proposed optimization model is quite high, and sometimes it cannot come up with feasible solutions. To this end, in this study, different regression and neural network methods have been proposed to predict network parameters and energy consumptions of underwater nodes as supplementary methods to optimization models. Performance evaluations show that the proposed methods yield remarkably accurate predictions and can be used for energy consumption prediction in UASNs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

Content related information that can be used in such strategies include information about the video frame type (Intra-Predicted, Inter-Predicted or Backward-Predicted). Frame type identification and prediction in the MAC layer scheduler (as well as in other network locations) is hence a critical part of content-aware resource management and traffic engineering in video streaming. It is important to note that, when encryption is adopted at the upper layers, packet inspection is not possible. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive clustering and prediction algorithm. The algorithm uses unsupervised clustering combined with an adaptive classification approach to automatically group packets into frame clusters. Unlike conventional video traffic classifiers, our approach requires neither a-priori knowledge of video frames pattern nor a training set of frames. Instead, this approach automatically classifies packets into different frame types by employing simple statistical features. The proposed method continuously learns from the upcoming traffic thus the proper frame class labels can be easily discovered. Furthermore, the proposed method uses an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm to predict the upcoming traffic frame type. A large number of experiments has been carried out using data from several video samples.

The network provides interactive voice and data telecommunication services for air traffic control in the region and, as such, requires high availability and performance. Outages do not only result in a degradation of service, but they also constitute safety risks.While network optimization in networks is typically the result of parameter measurements, more sophisticated and advanced solutions rely on real-time deep packet inspections to derive optimization parameters.However, Air Traffic Control (ATC) networks in the future will be protected by end-to-end encryption algorithms such as TLS or DTLS. That means that deep packet inspection will not be possible anymore, and the data plane can only see up to the transport layer information (port numbers), but not deeper.Different methods for network optimizations are needed. This paper describes an algorithm that uses Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to predict the probability of transmission errors in the satellite link communication. This prediction can then be used to perform such network optimizations. The ML concept described predicts the symbol energy-to-noise power density [energy per bit] of a satellite link.The complete satellite link performance data is combined with associated, regional weather data to create training samples for a regression type machine learning prediction. The training samples contain history and future windows so that the trained neural network is able to perform sequence to sequence predictions to output the predicted future symbol energy-to-noise power density.During the training a Tree Parzen hyperparameter optimizer is used to select the best fitting neural network topology and training parameters like neuron number or optimizer learning rate. Machine learning pipelines allow the execution of necessary data manipulation steps like sample filtering of invalid samples, interpolating missing sample values or necessary normalization.The concept was validated as part of the SINAPSE research project in the MEVA III network. The completed hyperparameter training of 30 models demonstrates that the trend of the energy-to-noise power density can be predicted correctly in many cases.

The challenge-response pairs (CRPs) data obtained from different ROPUFs is trained using different machine learning algorithms. From the study, it is found that the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models can be used to train the ROPUFs with a training accuracy of 99.9% and a prediction accuracy of 62% when 5,000 CRPs are used for a challenge-response ROPUF. In this article, we assume a realistic situation where a small set of the CRP dataset (approximately 15% maximum) is unscrupulously obtained by the hacker. A prediction accuracy of 62% makes the PUF vulnerable to machine learning attacks. Therefore, a secondary goal of this article is the design of a ROPUF capable of thwarting machine learning modeling attacks. The modified XOR-inverter ROPUF drastically reduces the prediction accuracy from 62% to 13.1%, thus making it increasingly difficult for hackers to attack the ROPUF. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery."

We extend the dimensions of these two types of features to enhance their capability for representing traffic data. Feature importance analysis and contrast experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our new features. Among our selected classifiers suitable for malicious traffic detection, boosting-based classifiers XGBoost and LightGBM can reduce bias, and bagging-based classifier Random Forest can reduce variance.

In these stock market investments, investors use fundamental analysis tools and indicators very widely. In this way, it is possible to have some knowledge of the situations experienced in the markets and to make a profit. In this study, manipulations on Bitcoin are discussed. Popular machine and statistical forecasting methods have been used to detect these manipulations and the road maps to be followed in order to be detected in the most successful way have been shared. Social media sentiments, which were thought to have an effect on manipulations during the studies, were also evaluated with the most advanced text analysis methods and evaluated together with these price changes. The allegations that the prediction methods carried out before the crisis were more successful were investigated. The Covid-19 pandemic was evaluated as a period of global crisis and the studies that might be relevant were examined. It would not be wrong to say that the actors that make big gains in the stock markets are the ones that determine the direction of the stock market. The manipulation periods of the market actors to be successful in the virtual money markets have been tried to be verified by various estimation methods. These estimations can achieve up to F1 score of 93% success according to our experimental result. Besides, it is stated that accounts with the highest volume of transactions in the periods, when anomalies were detected, were labeled as potential manipulators. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

mc-puf: memory-based and machine learning resilient strong puf for device authentication in internet of things,"williams p., idriss h., bayoumi m.","proceedings of the 2021 ieee international conference on cyber security and resilience, csr 2021",2021,10.1109/CSR51186.2021.9527930,authentication; constrained devices; mc-puf; modeling attack; resilient; security,1,Conference,IEEE Sponsored,"Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are hardware-based security primitives that utilize manufacturing process variations to realize binary keys (Weak PUFs) or binary functions (Strong PUFs). This primitive is desirable for key generation and authentication in constrained devices, due to its low power and low area overhead. However, in recent years many research papers are focused on the vulnerability of PUFs to modeling attacks. This attack is possible because the PUFs challenge and response exchanges are usually transmitted over communication channel without encryption. Thus, an attacker can collect challenge-response pairs and use it as input into a learning algorithm, to create a model that can predict responses given new challenges. In this paper we introduce a serial and a parallel novel 64-bits memory-based controlled PUF (Mc-PUF) architecture for device authentication that has high uniqueness and randomness, reliable, and resilient against modeling attacks. These architectures generate a response by utilizing bits extracted from the fingerprint of a synchronous random-access memory (SRAM) PUF with a control logic. The synthesis of the serial architecture yielded an area of 1.136K GE, while the parallel architecture was 3.013K GE. The best prediction accuracy obtained from the modeling attack was ~50%, which prevents an attacker from accurately predicting responses to future challenges. We also showcase the scalability of the design through XOR-ing several Mc-PUFs, further improving upon its security and performance. The remainder of the paper presents the proposed architectures, along with their hardware implementations, area and power consumption, and security resilience against modeling attacks. The 3-XOR Mc-PUF had the greatest overhead, but it produced the best randomness, uniqueness, and resilience against modeling attacks. © 2021 IEEE."

A PNG is defined to be correctly implemented if the next output sequence cannot be predicted with more than 0.5 (50%) chance of success without knowing the initial seed value. However, it was recently questioned in [14] if this criterion is still sufficient to provide adequate security if the generated primes are used for RSA encryption. This paper reinforces this claim and demonstrates how the entropy of randomly generated RSA prime factors p and q could be reduced by predicting up to seven decimal digits through a statistical distance analysis. As a proof of concept, two billion generated prime pairs were evaluated based on N = p · q and . Upper and lower boundaries as well as prime subregions related to could be identified. This allows to predict the first digits of a generated RSA prime with a probability up to 60%.

Traditional mobility prediction based optimisation and encryption approaches are reactive in nature; however, Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven proactive solutions are required for near real-time optimisation. Leveraging the historical passenger data recorded via Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors installed at the train stations, mobility prediction models can be developed to support and improve the railway operational performance vis-a-vis 5G and beyond. In this paper we have analysed the passenger traffic flows based on an Access, Egress and Interchange (AEI) framework to support train infrastructure against congestion, accidents, overloading carriages and maintenance. This paper predominantly focuses on developing passenger flow predictions using Machine Learning (ML) along with a novel encryption model that is capable of handling the heavy passenger traffic flow in real-time. We have compared and reported the performance of various ML driven flow prediction models using real-world passenger flow data obtained from London Underground and Overground (LUO). Extensive spatio-temporal simulations leveraging realistic mobility prediction models show that an AEI framework can achieve 91.17% prediction accuracy along with secure and light-weight encryption capabilities. Security parameters such as correlation coefficient (<0.01), entropy (>7.70), number of pixel change rate (>99%), unified average change intensity (>33), contrast (>10), homogeneity (<0.3) and energy (<0.01) prove the efficacy of the proposed encryption scheme. © 2020 by the authors.

In this work, we introduce and explore a new problem called the model-oblivious problem, where a trainer can delegate a protected model to a resource provider without revealing the original model itself to the resource provider. The resource provider can then offer prediction on a client's input data, which is additionally kept private from the resource provider. To solve this problem, we present MOBIUS (Model-Oblivious BInary neUral networkS), a new system that combines Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) and secure computation based on secret sharing as tools for scalable and fast privacy-preserving machine learning. BNNs improve computational performance by binarizing values in training to-1 and +1, while secure computation based on secret sharing provides fast and various computations under encrypted forms via modulo operations with a short bit length. However, combining these tools is not trivial because their operations have different algebraic structures. MOBIUS uses improved procedures of BNNs and secure computation that have compatible algebraic structures without downgrading prediction accuracy. We present an implementation of MOBIUS in C++ using the ABY library (NDSS 2015). Then, we conduct experiments using several datasets, including the MNIST, Cancer, and Diabetes datasets, and the results show that MOBIUS outperforms SecureML (IEEE S&P 2017), which is the only other work that can potentially tackle the model-oblivious problem, in terms of both accuracy and computational time. Compared with TAPAS (ICML 2018) as a state-of-The-Art BNN-based system, MOBIUS is three orders of magnitude faster without downgrading the accuracy despite solving the model-oblivious problem. © 2013 IEEE."

Such prediction is critical for security and network monitoring applications as they require application type to be known in prior. Traditional ways using port-based or payload-based analysis are not sufficient anymore as many applications start using dynamic unknown port numbers, masquerading, and encryption techniques to avoid being detected. Recently, machine learning has gained significant attention in many prediction applications including traffic classification from flow features or characteristics. However, such algorithms suffer from an imbalanced data problem where some applications have fewer flow data and hence difficult to predict. In this paper, we employ network flow-level characteristics to identify the application type of traffic. Furthermore, we propose the use of an improved support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, named cost-sensitive SVM (CMSVM), to solve the imbalance problem in network traffic identification. CMSVM adopts a multi-class SVM algorithm with active learning which dynamically assigns a weight for applications. We examine the classification accuracy and performance of the CMSVM algorithm using two different datasets, namely MOORE_SET and NOC_SET datasets. Our results show that the CMSVM algorithm can reduce computation cost, improve classification accuracy and solve the imbalance problem when compared to other machine learning techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Second, we use the historical trading data, daily Google Trends, and sentiment indicators to forecast the movement of cryptocurrency prices using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Third, we propose a portfolio optimization model by considering both the forecasting information and the global minimum variance model, and then derive the corresponding portfolio strategy. Finally, we compare the out-of-sample performance of the proposed strategy with classic portfolio strategies and the Cryptocurrency Index. The empirical results show that: on the one hand, the proposed multi-source data can effectively help forecast the cryptocurrency price movements; on the other hand, the proposed portfolio strategy outperforms traditional portfolio strategies regarding the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and certainty equivalent return, this proves that the proposed strategy can sufficiently combine information between history and future.

The objective of this paper is to develop a novel decomposition-ensemble learning model that combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) with machine learning algorithms to forecast the Bitcoin price multi-step ahead. The algorithms are k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel, Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with single-layer perceptron, Generalized Linear Model, and Cubist. Correlation matrix (CORR), principal component analysis (PCA), and Box-Cox transformation (BOXCOX) were used as data preprocessing techniques.

Given the high price and complexity, multi-tenancy has become a cost-effective pattern for QKD network operations. In this work, we concentrate on addressing the online multi-tenant provisioning (On-MTP) problem for QKD networks, where multiple tenant requests (TRs) arrive dynamically. On-MTP involves scheduling multiple TRs and assigning non-reusable secret keys derived from a QKD network to multiple TRs, where each TR can be regarded as a high-security-demand organization with the dedicated secret-key demand. The quantum key pools (QKPs) are constructed over QKD network infrastructure to improve management efficiency for secret keys. We model the secret-key resources for QKPs and the secret-key demands of TRs using distinct images. To realize efficient On-MTP, we perform a comparative study of heuristics and reinforcement learning (RL) based On-MTP solutions, where three heuristics (i.e., random, fit, and best-fit based On-MTP algorithms) are presented and a RL framework is introduced to realize automatic training of an On-MTP algorithm. The comparative results indicate that with sufficient training iterations the RL-based On-MTP algorithm significantly outperforms the presented heuristics in terms of tenant-request blocking probability and secret-key resource utilization."

Indeed, there has been a plethora of DL-based trading methods proposed in recent years. Despite the success of these methods, they typically rely on a very restricted set of information, usually employing only price-related information. As a result, they ignore sentiment-related information, which can have a profound impact and be a strong predictor of various assets, such as cryptocurencies. The contribution of this paper is multifold. First, we examine whether the use of sentiment information, as extracted by various online sources, including news articles, is beneficial when training DL agents for trading. Then, given the difficulty of training reliable sentiment extractors for financial applications, we evaluate the impact of using different DL models as sentiment extractors, as well as employ an unsupervised training pipeline for further improving their performance. Finally, we propose an effective multisource sentiment fusion approach that can improve the performance over the rest of the evaluated approaches. The conducted experiments have been performed using several different configurations and models, ranging from multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to provide a reliable evaluation of sentiment-aware DL-based trading strategies providing evidence that sentiment information might be a stronger predictor compared to the information provided by the actual price time series for Bitcoin. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

The blockchain is a tamper-evident, unforgeable distributed ledger that protects security and privacy through the famous algorithm zk-SNARK, which is also widely used in virtual digital currencies such as Zcash. In addition, by using zk-SNARK technology in the Loopring DEX 3.0 in Ethereum, not only decentralization but also transaction performance can be guaranteed. However, there are three main problems of zk-SNARK, one is the need to guarantee calculation accuracy, two is the long time to generate evidence, especially when using Lagrangian interpolation to QAP the transaction data requires more computation; the last is the poor scalability, especially when nodes need to recalculate all data when adding new transactions. In this paper, we propose a modified zk-SNARK based on Newtonian interpolation, improve the QAP part of zk-SNARK by Newtonian interpolation, and verify the correctness of the scheme through instantiation. Finally, we analyze the computational efficiency of the two interpolation methods, and the results show that Newton interpolation solves the above two problems in the original zk-SNARK, and significantly reduces the time complexity of the algorithm, which can further promote the application of blockchain in data management of AIoT. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

However, due to their uncertainty, volatility, and dynamism, forecasting crypto prices is a challenging time series analysis task. Researchers have proposed predictors based on statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches, but the literature is limited. Indeed, it is narrow because it focuses on predicting only the prices of the few most famous cryptos. In addition, it is scattered because it compares different models on different cryptos inconsistently, and it lacks generality because solutions are overly complex and hard to reproduce in practice. The main goal of this paper is to provide a comparison framework that overcomes these limitations. We use this framework to run extensive experiments where we compare the performances of widely used statistical, ML, and DL approaches in the literature for predicting the price of five popular cryptocurrencies, i.e., XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Monero (XMR). To the best of our knowledge, we are also the first to propose using the temporal fusion transformer (TFT) on this task. Moreover, we extend our investigation to hybrid models and ensembles to assess whether combining single models boosts prediction accuracy. Our evaluation shows that DL approaches are the best predictors, particularly the LSTM, and this is consistently true across all the cryptos examined. LSTM reaches an average RMSE of (Formula presented.) and MAE of (Formula presented.), respectively, (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) better than the second-best model.

For this purpose, a wide variety of GARCH-type models have been employed. However, there is no consensus in the literature on which specification arising from the volatility equation and the assumed error distribution is better in an out-of-sample performance. This study tries to fill this gap by comparing the forecasting performances of 110 GARCH-type models for Bitcoin volatility. Furthermore, it proposes a new combining method based on support vector machines (SVM). This method effectively selects the set of superior models to perform meta-learning. The results indicate that the best performing GARCH specification depends on the loss function chosen, and the proposed method leads to more accurate volatility forecasts than those of the best GARCH-type models and other combining methods investigated.

In this work, we focus on the two major cryptocurrencies for market capitalisation at the time of the study, Ethereum and Bitcoin, for the period 2017–2020. We present a comprehensive analysis of the predictability of price movements comparing four different deep learning algorithms (Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and Attention Long Short Term Memory (ALSTM)). We use three classes of features, considering a combination of technical (e.g. opening and closing prices), trading (e.g. moving averages) and social (e.g. users’ sentiment) indicators as input to our classification algorithm. We compare a restricted model composed of technical indicators only, and an unrestricted model including technical, trading and social media indicators. We found an increase in accuracy for the daily classification task from a range of 51%–55% for the restricted model to 67%–84% for the unrestricted one. This study demonstrates that including both trading and social media indicators yields a significant improvement in the prediction and accuracy consistently across all algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
on the determinants of bitcoin returns and volatility: what we get from gets?,"benhamed a., messai a.s., el montasser g.",sustainability (switzerland),2023,10.3390/su15031761,bitcoin; blockchain; c58; gets modelling; jel codes: c22; volatility,0,Journal,Q2,"Since Bitcoin has frequently witnessed price fluctuations and high volatility, the factors influencing its returns and volatility is an important research subject. To accomplish this goal, we applied the Gets reduction method which has a good reputation compared to other competing approaches in terms of the statistical apparatus available for a repeated search to determine the final set of determinants and the consideration of location shifts. We found that the reduced set of explanatory variables that affects Bitcoin returns is composed of Twitter-based economic uncertainty, gold return, the return of the Euro/USD exchange rate, the return of the US Nasdaq stock exchange index, market capitalization, and Bitcoin mining difficulty.

optimization of encrypted communication length based on generative adversarial network,"duan x., han y., wang c., ni h.","2021 ieee 4th international conference on big data and artificial intelligence, bdai 2021",2021,10.1109/BDAI52447.2021.9515301,loss function; machine learning; model optimization; neural network,1,Conference,IEEE Sponsored,"With the development of artificial intelligence and cryptography, intelligent cryptography will be the trend of encrypted communications in the future. Abadi designed an encrypted communication model based on a generative adversarial network, which can communicate securely when the adversary knows the ciphertext. The communication party and the adversary fight against each other to continuously improve their own capabilities to achieve a state of secure communication. However, this model can only have a better communication effect under the 16 bits communication length, and cannot adapt to the length of modern encrypted communication. Combine the neural network structure in DCGAN to optimize the neural network of the original model, and at the same time increase the batch normalization process, and optimize the loss function in the original model. Experiments show that under the condition of the maximum 2048-bit communication length, the decryption success rate of communication reaches about 0.97, while ensuring that the adversary's guess error rate is about 0.95, and the training speed is greatly increased to keep it below 5000 steps, ensuring safety and efficiency Communication. © 2021 IEEE."

Its great predictive power requires extensive computation, which encourages model owners to host the prediction service in a cloud platform. This article proposes a CNN prediction scheme that preserves privacy in the outsourced setting, i.e., the model-hosting server cannot learn the query, (intermediate) results, and the model. Similar to SecureML (S&P'17), a representative work that provides model privacy, we employ two non-colluding servers with secret sharing and triplet generation to minimize the usage of heavyweight cryptography. We made the following optimizations for both overall latency and accuracy. 1) We adopt asynchronous computation and SIMD for offline triplet generation and parallelizable online computation. 2) As MiniONN (CCS'17) and its improvement by the generic EzPC compiler (EuroS&P'19), we use a garbled circuit for the non-polynomial ReLU activation to keep the same accuracy as the underlying network (instead of approximating it in SecureML prediction). 3) For the pooling in CNN, we employ (linear) average-pooling, which achieves almost the same accuracy as the (non-linear, and hence less efficient) max-pooling exhibited by MiniONN and EzPC. Considering both offline and online costs, our experiments on the MNIST dataset show a latency reduction of 122×, 14.63×, and 36.69× compared to SecureML, MiniONN, and EzPC; and a reduction of communication costs by 1.09×, 36.69×, and 31.32×, respectively.

Although it can be used in several research areas, such as medical and financial, this paradigm introduces new security and privacy problems. In response to the ciphertext classification requirements in different scenarios in outsourcing environments, this paper proposed an outsourced privacy-preserving decision tree classification model based on homomorphic encryption, which can hide sensitive inputs (model and query) and outputs (analytic result) from a counterparty. A secure exclusive OR (XOR) protocol is created; it intelligently computes the XOR of two bit-encrypted data to obtain another bit-encrypted result. The experimental results show that the proposed protocols are particularly efficient for outsourced decision trees, which are encrypted and stored in the cloud. These decision trees are typical of classification models trained from real datasets, ranging from heart disease to cancer classification. © 2020"

Traditionally, this trend has been primarily seen as a serious risk for cryptography; however, a positive aspect of quantum technology should also be stressed. In this regard, viewing this technology as a resource for honest parties rather than adversaries, it may enhance not only the security, but also the performance of specific cryptographic schemes. While considerable effort has been devoted to the design of quantum-resistant and quantum-enhanced schemes, little effort has been made to understanding their physical security. Physical security deals with the design and implementation of security measures fulfilling the practical requirements of cryptographic primitives, which are equally essential for classic and quantum ones. This survey aims to draw greater attention to the importance of physical security, with a focus on secure key generation and storage as well as secure execution. More specifically, the possibility of performing side-channel analysis in the quantum world is discussed and compared to attacks launched in the classic world. Besides, proposals for quantum random number generation and quantum physically unclonable functions are compared to their classic counterparts and further analyzed to give a better understanding of their features, advantages, and shortcomings. Finally, seen from these three perspectives, this survey provides an outlook for future research in this direction."

Unfortunately, malware-derived PowerShell Commands (PSCmds) have typically been obfuscated to hide the malicious intent from detection and analysis. Also, malicious PSCmds' expansive use of multiple obfuscation strategies and encryption methods makes them difficult to be revealed. Despite the advances in malicious PSCmds detection incorporating new approaches such as machine learning and deep learning, there is still no consensus on the solution to de-obfuscating malicious PSCmds and profiling their behavior. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid framework that combines deep learning and program analysis for automatic PowerShell De-obfuscation and behavioral Profiling (PowerDP) through multi-label classification in a static manner. First, we use character distribution features to forecast obfuscation types of malicious PSCmds. Second, we developed an extensive de-obfuscator utilizing static regular expression replacement to recover the original content of obfuscated PSCmds based on the predicted obfuscation types. Finally, we profile the behavior of PSCmds by features extracted from the abstract syntax tree of PSCmds after de-obfuscation. Our results show that PowerDP achieves a promising 99.82% accuracy and 0.18% hamming loss in obfuscation multi-label classification using deep learning. Furthermore, the successful recovery rate of the de-obfuscator against 15 obfuscation types is 98.11% on average with semantic similarity comparison, and the accuracy of the behavior multi-label classification for identifying 5 behaviors in malicious PSCmds averages 98.53%.

predicting optimal parameters with random forest for quantum key distribution,"ding h.-j., liu j.-y., zhang c.-m., wang q.",quantum information processing,2020,10.1007/s11128-019-2548-3,parameters prediction; quantum key distribution; random forest,21,Journal,Q2,"For practical quantum key distribution (QKD) in finite-data case, full optimized parameters can greatly improve its key rate. To gain such optimal parameters, traditional search algorithms are performed quite frequently despite the high time and hardware overhead, which may be a severe challenge for real-time QKD systems and large-scale QKD networks. In this paper, instead of searching optimal parameters, we employ random forest to directly predict those parameters. Firstly, we illustrate the feasibility of this method with 3-intensity measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD). Later, we rebuild a versatile model applicable to MDI and BB84 protocol simultaneously. Both numerical simulations demonstrate our method enjoys a low time and hardware overhead compared with traditional search method and achieves over 99% of the optimal secure key rate as well, which is very promising in future QKD applications. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

However, the challenge in predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate is its high volatility. Therefore, the prediction of its behavior is of great importance for financial markets. In this way, recent studies have been carried out on what internal and/or external Bitcoin information is relevant to its prediction. The increased use of machine learning techniques to predict time series and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments motivated the present study to seek more accurate predictions for the Bitcoin exchange rate. In this way, in a first stage of the proposed methodology, different feature selection techniques were evaluated in order to obtain the most relevant attributes for the predictions. In the sequence, it was analyzed the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble algorithms (based on Recurrent Neural Networks and the k-Means clustering method) for price direction predictions. Likewise, the ANN and SVM were employed for regression of the maximum, minimum and closing prices of the Bitcoin. Moreover, the regression results were also used as inputs to try to improve the price direction predictions. The results showed that the selected attributes and the best machine learning model achieved an improvement of more than 10%, in accuracy, for the price direction predictions, with respect to the state-of-the-art papers, using the same period of information. In relation to the maximum, minimum and closing Bitcoin prices regressions, it was possible to obtain Mean Absolute Percentage Errors between 1% and 2%. Based on these results, it was possible to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology when compared to other studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

In this paper, we present a novel machine-learning model, solving a binary classification problem, that can predict transaction fee volatility in the Bitcoin network so that users can optimize their fees expenses and the approval time for their transactions. The model's output will give a confidence score whether a new incoming transaction will be included in the next mined block. The model is trained on data from a longitudinal study of the Bitcoin blockchain, containing more than 10 million transactions. New features that we generate include information on how many bytes were already occupied by other transactions in the mempool, assuming they are ordered by fee density in each mining pool.

SMPC enables secret-sharing of private models and client inputs with non-colluding secure servers to compute predictions without leaking model parameters and inputs. DP masks true prediction results via noisy aggregation so as to deter a semi-honest client who may mount membership inference attacks.

With the continuous exploitation of data value and the proliferation of machine learning-as-a-service, convolutional neural network prediction schemes on privacy preservation have been introduced one after another, which makes much more attention focused on the privacy leakage and services offered to be efficient and light. Therefore, how to improve the convolutional neural prediction scheme on the premise of privacy preservation turns out to be an imperative research issue. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving convolutional neural network prediction scheme (PCP-LL) that supports low latency and lightweight users. The scheme starts from the perspective of lossless accuracy from underlying networks. First, we construct a secure activation function computing protocol (SActF) utilizing a commodity-based secure comparison protocol, which reduces the complexity and latency during the activation function computing under ciphertexts compared with common schemes. Second, to further support lightweight users, we introduce a secure output layer protocol (SOut) that enables users to obtain the prediction results without extra decryption after simple operations. Then, the scheme adopts the distributed two trapdoors public-key cryptosystem (DT-PKC) to achieve both data and model security, which well avoids security issues especially such as wiretapping by semi-honest participants commonly in secret sharing schemes.

This is the reason why the outsourced data need to be dealt with securely, where data encryption is considered to be the most straightforward method to keep the privacy of data, but machine learning on the data in ciphertext domain is more complicated than the plaintext, since the relationship structure between data is no longer maintained, in such a way that we focus on the machine learning over encrypted big data. In this work, we study locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), a widely used classic machine learning algorithm in real-world, such as predict and find the best-fit curve through numerous data points. To tackle the privacy concerns in utilizing the LWLR algorithm, we present a system for privacy-preserving locally weighted linear regression, where the system not only protects the privacy of users but also encrypts the best-fit curve. Therefore, we use Paillier homomorphic encryption as the building modular to encrypt data and then apply the stochastic gradient descent in encrypted domain. After given a security analysis, we study how to let Paillier encryption deal with real numbers and implement the system in Python language with a couple of experiments on real-world data sets to evaluate the effectiveness, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art and occurs negligible errors compared with performing locally weighted linear regression in the clear. © 2013 IEEE."

They are novel techniques allowing to process private information without disclosing it to persons engaged in processing. One of the main applications of such security tools is the creation of personalized information services, which opens up new opportunities for business and reduces the risks of unauthorized access to personal data. We review important building blocks for cryptographic protection of data processing, such as zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computations, and homomorphic encryption. Often, personalized information services are based on data mining and machine learning, so privacy-preserved machine learning is a very important building block for them. We analyze the concept of differential privacy which serves as the basis for privacy-preserving machine learning and some other cryptographic schemes.

private machine learning classification based on fully homomorphic encryption,"sun x., zhang p., liu j.k., yu j., xie w.",ieee transactions on emerging topics in computing,2020,10.1109/TETC.2018.2794611,decision tree; fully homomorphic encryption; hyperplane decision-based; machine learning classification; naïve bayes; privacy preserving,43,Journal,Q2,"Machine learning classification is an useful tool for trend prediction by analyzing big data. As supporting homomorphic operations over encrypted data without decryption, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) contributes to machine learning classification without leaking user privacy, especially in the outsouring scenario. In this paper, we propose an improved FHE scheme based on HElib, which is a FHE library implemented based on Brakerski's FHE scheme. Our improvement focuses on two aspects. On the one hand, we first use the relinearization technique to reduce the ciphertext size, and then the modulus switching technique is used to reduce the modulus and decryption noise. On the other hand, we need no relinearization and modulus switching if there is additive homomorphic or no homomorphic operation in the multiplicative ciphertext's next homomorphic operation. Homomorphic comparison protocol, private hyperplane decision-based classification and private Naïve Bayes classification are implemented by additive homomorphic and multiplicative homomorphic first. In our homomorphic comparison protocol, the number of interactions is reduced from 3 to 1. We choose the proposed FHE scheme to implement private decision tree classification. Simulation results show that the efficiency of our FHE scheme and implementation of private decision tree classification are more efficient than other two schemes. © 2013 IEEE."

MLaaS applications often rely on centralised collection and aggregation of user data, which could lead to significant privacy concerns when dealing with sensitive personal data. To address this problem, we propose PrivEdge, a technique for privacy-preserving MLaaS that safeguards the privacy of users who provide their data for training, as well as users who use the prediction service. With PrivEdge, each user independently uses their private data to locally train a one-class reconstructive adversarial network that succinctly represents their training data. As sending the model parameters to the service provider in the clear would reveal private information, PrivEdge secret-shares the parameters among two non-colluding MLaaS providers, to then provide cryptographically private prediction services through secure multi-party computation techniques. We quantify the benefits of PrivEdge and compare its performance with state-of-the-art centralised architectures on three privacy-sensitive image-based tasks: individual identification, writer identification, and handwritten letter recognition. Experimental results show that PrivEdge has high precision and recall in preserving privacy, as well as in distinguishing between private and non-private images. Moreover, we show the robustness of PrivEdge to image compression and biased training data. The source code is available at https://github.com/smartcameras/PrivEdge. © 2005-2012 IEEE."

Proteome-wide identification of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) has proven valuable in the systematic understanding of the genome-phenome relationship. However, the PPIs of C. parvum are largely unknown because of the limited experimental studies carried out. Therefore, we took full advantage of three bioinformatics methods, i.e., interolog mapping (IM), domain-domain interaction (DDI)-based inference, and machine learning (ML) method, to jointly predict PPIs of C. parvum. Due to the lack of experimental PPIs of C. parvum, we used the PPI data of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), which owned the largest number of PPIs in Apicomplexa, to train an ML model to infer C. parvum PPIs. We utilized consistent results of these three methods as the predicted high-confidence PPI network, which contains 4,578 PPIs covering 554 proteins. To further explore the biological significance of the constructed PPI network, we also conducted essential network and protein functional analysis, mainly focusing on hub proteins and functional modules. We anticipate the constructed PPI network can become an important data resource to accelerate the functional genomics studies of C. parvum as well as offer new hints to the target discovery in developing drugs/vaccines. © 2022 The Author(s)"

People have been using learning tools from diverse fields such as financial mathematics and machine learning to make trustworthy forecasting on such markets. However, the accuracy of such techniques had not been adequate until artificial neural network frameworks such as long short-term memory (LSTM) were utilized. Moreover, making accurate real-time forecasting, also known as nowcasting, of financial time series is highly subjective to the LSTM's architecture in use and the procedure of training it. Herein, we forecast financial markets in real-time by training a dual version of LSTM which forecasts only one time step at each iteration so that the forecast for this iteration will be in the input for the next iteration. Semi-convergence is a prominent issue in a recurrent LSTM setup as the error could propagate through iterations; however, the duality of this LSTM aids in dwindling this issue. Especially, we employ one LSTM to find the best number of epochs associated with the least loss and train the second LSTM only through that many epochs to make forecasting. We treat the current forecast as a part of the training set for the next forecast and train the same LSTM. While classic ways of training cause more error when the forecast is made further away through the test period, our approach offers superior accuracy as the training increases when it proceeds through the testing period. The forecasting accuracy of our approach is validated using three time series from each of the three diverse financial markets: stock, cryptocurrency, and commodity. The results are compared with those of a single LSTM, an extended Kalman filter, and an autoregressive integrated moving average model. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

There are many algorithms for price prediction for crypto currencies like LSTM and ARIMA. However, the downside is that LSTM-based RNNs are difficult to comprehend, and gaining intuition into their behavior is tough. In order to produce decent outcomes, rigorous hyperparameter adjustment is also essential. Furthermore, crypto currencies do not precisely adhere to past data, and patterns change fast, reducing the accuracy of predictions. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Because the data is dynamic and heavily influenced by various seasons, the ARIMA model is unable to handle seasonal data. In order to provide better price predictions for crypto traders, a new model is required. The objective of the study is to apply Fbprophet model as the key model because it is superior in functionality as compared to LSTM and ARIMA additionally removing the pitfalls generated in LSTM and ARIMA model while analyzing the cryptocurrency data. This study provides a methodology for predicting the future price of bitcoin that does not rely solely on past data due to seasonality in historical data. So, after fitting the seasonality and smoothing, the model is constructed that can be useful for real-world use cases. In case of crypto currencies where less historical data is available and it is hard to find pattern, proposed method can easily deal this type of problems. Overall difference between predicted and actual values is low as compared to other model even after seasonal data was available. © 2022"

However, several investors' capital decreased when they tried to trade the basis of the recommendation of these strategies. That means the stock market needs more satisfactory research, which can give more guarantee of success for investors. To address this challenge, we tried to apply one of the machine learning algorithms, which is called deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on the stock market.

regulating cryptocurrencies: a supervised machine learning approach to de-anonymizing the bitcoin blockchain,"yin h.h.s., langenheldt k., harlev m., mukkamala r.r., vatrapu r.",journal of management information systems,2019,10.1080/07421222.2018.1550550,bitcoin; blockchain; cryptocurrencies; cybercrime; cybersecurity; online anonymity; supervised machine learning,107,Journal,Q1,"Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency whose transactions are recorded on a distributed, openly accessible ledger. On the Bitcoin Blockchain, an owning entity’s real-world identity is hidden behind a pseudonym, a so-called address. Therefore, Bitcoin is widely assumed to provide a high degree of anonymity, which is a driver for its frequent use for illicit activities. This paper presents a novel approach for de-anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilized a sample of 957 entities (with ≈385 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 12 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm with default parameters, we achieve a mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.42% and F1-score of ≈79.64%. We show two examples, one where we predict on a set of 22 clusters that are suspected to be related to cybercriminal activities, and another where we classify 153,293 clusters to provide an estimation of the activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem. We discuss the potential applications of our method for organizational regulation and compliance, societal implications, outline study limitations, and propose future research directions. A prototype implementation of our method for organizational use is included in the appendix. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

resilient machine learning for networked cyber physical systems: a survey for machine learning security to securing machine learning for cps,"olowononi, fo; rawat, db; liu, c",ieee communications surveys and tutorials,2021,10.1109/COMST.2020.3036778,security; computer security; machine learning; wireless sensor networks; resilience; sensor systems; computers; adversarial attacks; cybersecurity; machine learning; resiliency in cyber physical systems,55,Journal,Q1,"Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are characterized by their ability to integrate the physical and information or cyber worlds. Their deployment in critical infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However, harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment. An attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending information from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium, thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most research work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS. However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain functional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant methodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient. This article is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions between resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper concludes with a number of research trends and promising future research directions. Furthermore, with this article, readers can have a thorough understanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area."
reversible data hiding in encrypted images based on adaptive prediction and labeling,"qin j., he z., xiang x., xiong n.n.","computers, materials and continua",2022,10.32604/cmc.2022.030372,adaptive gradient prediction; embedding capacity; huffman coding; reversible data hiding,0,Journal,Q2,"Recently, reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) based on pixel prediction has been a hot topic. However, existing schemes still employ a pixel predictor that ignores pixel changes in the diagonal direction during prediction, and the pixel labeling scheme is inflexible. To solve these problems, this paper proposes reversible data hiding in encrypted images based on adaptive prediction and labeling. First, we design an adaptive gradient prediction (AGP), which uses eight adjacent pixels and combines four scanning methods (i.e., horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and diagonal) for prediction. AGP can adaptively adjust the weight of the linear prediction model according to the weight of the edge attribute of the pixel, which improves the prediction ability of the predictor for complex images. At the same time, we adopt an adaptive huffman coding labeling scheme, which can adaptively generate huffman codes for labeling according to different images, effectively improving the scheme's embedding performance on the dataset. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a higher embedding rate. The embedding rate on the test image Jetplane is 4.2102 bpp, and the average embedding rate on the image dataset Bossbase is 3.8625 bpp. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved."

Thus at present, many researchers are focus on analyzing and forecasting. The existing studies on Bitcoin price prediction are mainly in two ways: (1) study how economic factors, market and investor sentiment indicators influence Bitcoin price; (2) apply machine learning and artificial neural networks to predict the value of Bitcoin. This paper aims to implement a scenario analysis method to generate various hypothetical events and then determine their effects on the value of Bitcoin price. Scenario analysis is normally used to measure financial risk. In this paper, we propose a method that combines scenario analysis with historical data. We further aim to find the correlations among scenarios and examine the relationship between the significant shocks and Bitcoin prices. Our findings suggest that what-if analysis is a good way to measure the risk exposure of Bitcoin. The method can also be used for worse-scenario analysis to check how Bitcoin performs during crisis periods. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

The general expressions of secrecy rates of the data and key are derived separately. Furthermore, the maximum reachable secrecy rate of a QAM-QNRC system is put forward, under which the data and key are both safe in the view of mutual information evaluation. Finally, the variation trend of secrecy rate with various system parameters is discussed in detail. The simulation results show that we can obtain a higher secrecy rate by setting reasonable parameters, such as the level of ciphertext, mesoscopic signal power, and inner gain at the transmitter.

The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell.

Simply centralizing these multi-sourced data for training would raise critical security and privacy concerns, and might be prohibited given the increasingly strict data regulations. To resolve the tension between privacy and data utilization in distributed learning, a machine learning framework called private aggregation of teacher ensembles (PATE) has been recently proposed. PATE harnesses the knowledge (label predictions for an unlabeled dataset) from distributed teacher models to train a student model, obviating access to distributed datasets. Despite being enticing, PATE does not offer protection for the individual label predictions from teacher models, which still entails privacy risks. In this paper, we propose SEDML, a new protocol which allows to securely and efficiently harness the distributed knowledge in machine learning. SEDML builds on lightweight cryptography and provides strong protection for the individual label predictions, as well as differential privacy guarantees on the aggregation results. Extensive evaluations show that while providing privacy protection, SEDML preserves the accuracy as in the plaintext baseline. Meanwhile, SEDML outperforms the state-of-the-art work of Xiang et al.

Cryptocurrency works similar to standard currency, however, virtual payments are made for goods and services without the intervention of any central authority. Although cryptocurrency ensures legitimate and unique transactions by utilizing cryptographic methods, this industry is still in its inception and serious concerns have been raised about its use. Analysis of the sentiments about cryptocurrency is highly desirable to provide a holistic view of peoples' perceptions. In this regard, this study performs both sentiment analysis and emotion detection using the tweets related to the cryptocurrency which are widely used for predicting the market prices of cryptocurrency. For increasing the efficacy of the analysis, a deep learning ensemble model LSTM-GRU is proposed that combines two recurrent neural networks applications including long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). LSTM and GRU are stacked where the GRU is trained on the features extracted by LSTM. Utilizing term frequency-inverse document frequency, word2vec, and bag of words (BoW) features, several machine learning and deep learning approaches and a proposed ensemble model are investigated. Furthermore, TextBlob and Text2Emotion are studied for emotion analysis with the selected models. Comparatively, a larger number of people feel happy with the use of cryptocurrency, followed by fear and surprise emotions. Results suggest that the performance of machine learning models is comparatively better when BoW features are used. The proposed LSTM-GRU ensemble shows an accuracy of 0.99 for sentiment analysis, and 0.92 for emotion prediction and outperforms both machine learning and state-of-the-art models. © 2013 IEEE."

Asset pricing is a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders. Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model, we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario. © 2020 IEEE."

Specifically, we focus on the case when the observers perform a kind of a minimum-error type state discriminating measurement where the goal of the observers is to maximize their joint probability of successfully guessing the state that the qubit was initially prepared in. We call this the Joint Best Guess strategy. In this scheme, Alice prepares a qubit in one of two possible states. The qubit is first sent to Bob, who measures it, and then on to Charlie, and so on to altogether N consecutive receivers who all perform measurements on it. The goal for all observers is to determine which state Alice sent. In the Joint Best Guess strategy, every time a system is received the observer is required to make a guess, aided by the measurement, about its state. The price to pay for this requirement is that errors must be permitted, the guess can be correct or in error. There is a nonzero probability for all the receivers to successfully identify the initially prepared state, and we maximize this joint probability of success. This work is a step toward developing a theory of nondestructive sequential quantum measurements and could be useful in multiparty quantum communication schemes based on communicating with single qubits, particularly in schemes employing continuous variable states. It also represents a case where subsequent observers can probabilistically and optimally get around both the collapse postulate and the no-broadcasting theorem."

However, one may claim that the actual deployment of e-Voting is at its infancy, mainly due to election integrity issues such as vote non-tampering, voter anonymity, and vote verifiability. The integration of cryptography and blockchain technology in a single framework could provide a solid foundation for secure, anonymous and still verifiable electronic voting. The TrustedEVoting (TeV) framework is a blockchain-based eVoting approach, which wraps not only the required key elements for secure and verifiable e-Voting but also additional features such as support for re-voting and post-election vote check, among others. This paper presents a novel feature to be integrated in TeV, the smart voting ballot, that implements a rankedchoice voting by allowing the voter to cast two votes: a primary vote and an alternative vote. The latter one is utilized in the case the primary vote went to an election party that didn't reach the threshold. In this way, a more flexible voting scheme is available to a voter, mitigating the voter reluctancy to vote for smaller parties. In order to protect the voter's privacy by not revealing trends/preferences/statistics regarding the two votes, an intelligent mechanism is in place that provides a privacy shield for the alternative votes not being used in the voting tallying."

These transformations are performed in two successive stages: The first stage is based on the smoothing technique for the development of a new de-noised version of the original series in which every value contains dynamic knowledge of the all previous values. The second stage of transformations is performed on the smoothed series and it is based on differencing the series in order to be stationary and be considerably easier fitted and analyzed by a deep learning model.

The difference from the current study is that Twitter sentiment and Google trends have not been used as a predictor in a neuro-fuzzy network before. ANFIS has the advantage of combining the properties of fuzzy systems and neural networks. This advantage is manifested in producing lower error and higher accuracy in predictions. According to the findings, different results were obtained for different cryptocurrencies in the model in which the ANFIS estimation method was used.

The video streaming session is subdivided into a stream of short time slots of 1s length, while considering two additional macro windows each for the current streaming trend and the whole ongoing streaming session. Constant memory features are extracted from the encrypted network traffic in these three windows in a stream-based fashion, and fed into a random forest model, which predicts whether the current time slot contains stalling or not. The presented system can predict stalling with a very high accuracy and the finest granularity to date (1s), and thus, can be used in networks for real-time QoE analysis from encrypted YouTube video streaming traffic. The independent predictions for each consecutive slot of a streaming session can further be aggregated to obtain stalling estimations for the whole session. Thereby, the proposed method allows to quantify the initial delay, as well as the overall number of stalling events and the stalling ratio, i.e., the ratio of total stalling time and total playback time. © 2019 IEEE."

Literature shows that business analysts always tend to use new technologies and investigate their risks. Some researchers predicted the price fluctuations and investigated the risk of cryptocurrency and blockchain network. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study which provides the feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The other cryptocurrencies are not included in the study because of having insufficient relevant data on the social forums. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Apart from that, the public perception and environment feasibility are also determined. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden shows positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment. Which ranks the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the significant terms are also determined using Topic modeling from public opinions. Such as authorization rules, investment, profit, volatility, and security etc. These terms are almost identified as subtopic for each of the inquired keyword.

BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems. We also present a conceptual architecture TAIRA-BSC proof of concept that is developed to serve as a foundation for future studies focused on enhancing trust in AI applications through the integration of BCT. © 2022 IEEE."

The quality of a project affects the trust in the platform, and therefore the value of the digital tokens exchanged over it. In this paper, we investigate whether developers’ emotions can effectively provide insights that can improve the prediction of the price of tokens. We consider developers’ comments and activity for two major blockchain projects, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, extracted from Github. We measure sentiment and emotions (joy, love, anger, etc.) of the developers’ comments over time, and test the corresponding time series (i.e. the affect time series) for correlations and causality with the Bitcoin/Ethereum time series of prices. Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers’ emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price. Moreover, using an artificial recurrent neural network (LSTM), we can show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)—associated with the prediction of the prices of cryptocurrencies—significantly decreases when including the affect time series. © 2020, The Author(s)."

Under the assumption that the cryptocurrency market has unobserved heterogeneity, an HMM allows us to study (1) the extent to which cryptocurrency markets shift due to interactions with social sentiment during a bull or bear market and (2) the heterogeneous pattern of cryptocurrency market behavior under these two market conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors advance the HMM model based on two six-month datasets (from November 2017 to April 2018 for a bull market and from December 2018 to May 2019 for a bear market) collected from Google, Twitter, the stock market and cryptocurrency trading platforms in South Korea. Social sentiment data were collected by crawling Bitcoin-related posts on Twitter. Findings: The authors highlight the reaction of the cryptocurrency market to social sentiment under a bull and a bear market and in two hidden states (an upward and a downward trend). They find: (1) social sentiment is relatively relevant during a bull compared to a bear market. (2) The cryptocurrency market in a downward state, that is, with a local decreasing trend, tends to be more responsive to positive social sentiment. (3) The market in an upward state, that is, with a local increasing trend, tends to better interact with negative social sentiment. Originality/value: The proposed HMM model contributes to a theoretically grounded understanding of how cryptocurrency markets respond to social sentiment in bull and bear markets through varied sequences adjusted for cryptocurrency market heterogeneity. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

A combination of newly available features allows IBM z15 to scale to greater than 5,000 Virtual Hardware secure modules per system and makes it suitable to support virtualized client environments such as cloud-scale datacenters. To meet the dense packaging and energy requirements of those data centers, the form factor and power consumption of the card were reduced significantly. The card also offers an expanded set of algorithms to support state-of-the-art as well as future workloads. For the first time, the user interface provides access to a selected set of quantum-safe algorithms. Infrastructure extensions add hardware-embedded, attestation-friendly trusted boot services, which improve system resiliency by providing hardware enabled measurements of the secure and trusted boot process.

However, much less work has been performed around the security of edge AI. Machine learning models are a mass of intellectual property, and an optimized network is very valuable. Trained machine learning models need to be black boxes as well because they may give away information about the training data to the outside world. As selecting the appropriate activation functions to enable fast training of accurate deep neural networks is an active area of research, it is important to conceal the information of the activation functions used in a neural network architecture as well. There has been research on the use of physical attacks such as the side-channel attack (SCA) in areas other than cryptography. The SCA is highly effective against edge artificial intelligence due to its property of the device computing close to the user. We studied a previously proposed method to retrieve the activation functions of a black box neural network implemented on an edge device by using simple electromagnetic analysis (SEMA) and improved the signal processing procedure for further noisy measurements. The SEMA attack identifies activation functions by directly observing distinctive electromagnetic (EM) traces that correspond to the operations in the activation function. This method requires few executions and inputs and also has little implementation dependency on the activation functions. We distinguished eight similar activation functions with EM measurements and examined the versatility and limits of this attack.

The same applies to exchange rates of unbacked currencies. Albeit, empirically investors are found to be driven by online and offline news media. This study analyzes the Bitcoin cryptocurrency price series and web search queries with regard to their mutual predictability and cause-effect delay structure. Chinese Baidu engine searches and compounded Baidu–Google search statistics predict Bitcoin price dynamics at relatively high frequencies ranging from 2 to 5 months. In the other direction, Granger-causality runs from the cryptocurrency price to queries statistics across nearly all frequencies. In both directions, the reaction time computed from a phase delay measure for the relevant frequency bands with significant causality ranges from about 1 to 4 months. For either direction, out-of-sample forecasts are more accurate than forecasts of a benchmark stochastic process. Bivariate models including the Baidu Search Index slightly outperform competing models that include a Baidu–Google composite index.

Hence, it is essential to implement security schemes and to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of electronic circuits. Toward this end, the concept of physically unclonable functions (PUFs) has been established at the beginning of the 21st century. However, most PUFs have eventually, at least partially, fallen short of their promises, which are unpredictability, unclonability, uniqueness, reproducibility, and tamper resilience. That is because most PUFs directly utilize the underlying microelectronics, but that intrinsic randomness can be limited and may thus be predicted, especially by machine learning. Optical PUFs, in contrast, are still considered as promising-they can derive strong, hard-to-predict randomness independently from microelectronics, by using some kind of âoptical token.â Here, we propose a novel concept for plasmonics-enhanced optical PUFs, or peo-PUFs in short. For the first time, we leverage two highly nonlinear phenomena in conjunction by construction: first, light propagation in a silicon disk resonator, and second, surface plasmons arising from nanoparticles arranged randomly on top of the resonator. We elaborate on the physical phenomena, provide simulation results, and conduct a security analysis of peo-PUFs for secure key generation and authentication.

In addition to the risk of unstable reward flows, the fluctuation in Bitcoin price makes the profitability of mining more uncertain. This research studies an alternative socially optimal model for the Bitcoin market (and other cryptocurrencies in general). Through equilibrium analysis, we emphasize the need to limit speculation in Bitcoin transactions, improve efficiency, diversify currency portfolio, and minimize negative externalities of the Bitcoin mining business."

Bitcoin, the leading crypto currency, reached all-time highs many times over the year leading to speculations to explain the trend in its growth. In this paper, we study Bitcoin and explore features in its network that explain its price hikes. We gather data and analyze user and network activity that highly impact Bitcoin price. We monitor the change in the activities over time and relate them to economic theories. We identify key network features that determine the demand and supply dynamics of a crypto currency. Finally, we use machine learning methods to construct models that predict Bitcoin price. Our regression model predicts Bitcoin price with 99.4% accuracy and 0.0113 root mean squared error (RMSE)."

Even the trained model parameters or prediction can pose serious privacy leakage. To address these problems, we demonstrate a generally applicable Distributed Privacy-Preserving Prediction (DPPP) framework, in which instead of sharing more sensitive data or model parameters, an untrusted aggregator combines only multiple models' predictions under provable privacy guarantee. Our framework integrates two main techniques to guarantee individual privacy. First, we introduce the improved Binomial Mechanism and Discrete Gaussian Mechanism to achieve distributed differential privacy. Second, we utilize homomorphic encryption to ensure that the aggregator learns nothing but the noisy aggregated prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework has comparable performance to the non-private frameworks and delivers better results than the local differentially private framework and standalone framework. © 2020 IEEE."

In this paper, we present a new machine learning approach, named TraderNetCR, which is based on deep reinforcement learning. TraderNet-CR combines both methodologies in order to detect profitable round trips in the cryptocurrency market and maximize a trader's profits. Additionally, we have added an extension method, named N-Consecutive Actions, which examines the model's previous actions, before suggesting a new action. This method is complementary to the model's training and can be fruitfully combined, in order to further decrease the trading risk.

Transactions substituting money over Ethereum space are carried out using Ethereum's cryptocurrency `Ether'. Though the decentralization and public ledger recording of the transactions proves its limpidity, the anonymity of the users, hiding their true identity behind the addresses echoes the need for discerning the behavioural traits in transactions. The appalling nature of Ethereum transactions to have both, security and threat at a comparable level, demands analytics for inferring traits for better perspectives and insights. This research work focuses on characteristic analysis of Ethereum transaction space for inferring behavioural traits in supervised and unsupervised context. In an unsupervised environment, raw transaction data is extradited to a tabular transaction structure by selecting appropriate features. The data is further clustered and validated to form coherent groupings of similar patterns. The clusters are characteristically analyzed based on the features through Radar plots for inferring behavioural traits. In supervised context, labelled transactions are represented using histograms and feature-based characteristic analysis is performed to infer traits. Such analytics lay foundations for future deeper analysis that can be used to discover trends and patterns to understand the transaction network, enhancement of trading strategies, identification of bot activities, anomaly detection and several others."

Findings from our review show that the practitioner-oriented literature foreshadowed the rise of FinTech by extensively reporting on algorithm-based and electronic trading (2009 onwards), followed by reporting on FinTech start-ups and funding successes (2014 onwards). The practitioner literature subsequently reported on alternative finance models, the introduction of cryptocurrencies, and risks and regulatory issues. Academic literature on FinTech began to rise from 2014 onwards, focusing initially on the development of FinTech in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Research attention subsequently shifted to FinTech innovations (alternative finance, cryptocurrency and blockchain, machine-based methods for financial analysis and forecasting, including artificial intelligence), as well as risk and regulatory issues. IS work on FinTech started to emerge from 2015 onwards, initially focusing on mobile payment systems and peer-to-peer lending. However, the body of work at the intersection of FinTech and IS is still small.

Namely, it allows a buyer to purchase an item from a seller without disclosing to the latter which item was purchased and at which price. Unfortunately, existing POT schemes have some drawbacks in terms of design and functionality. First, the design of existing POT schemes is not modular. Typically, a POT scheme extends a k-out-of-N oblivious transfer (OT) scheme by adding prices to the items. However, all POT schemes do not use OT as a black-box building block with certain security guarantees. Consequently, security of the OT scheme needs to be reanalyzed while proving security of the POT scheme, and it is not possible to swap the underlying OT scheme with any other OT scheme. Second, existing POT schemes do not allow the seller to obtain any kind of statistics about the buyer's purchases, which hinders customer and sales management. Moreover, the seller is not able to change the prices of items without restarting the protocol from scratch. We propose a POT scheme that addresses the aforementioned drawbacks. We prove the security of our POT in the UC framework. We modify a standard POT functionality to allow the seller to receive aggregate statistics about the buyer's purchases and to change prices dynamically. We present a modular construction for POT that realizes our functionality in the hybrid model. One of the building blocks is an ideal functionality for OT. Therefore, our protocol separates the tasks carried out by the underlying OT scheme from the additional tasks needed by a POT scheme. Thanks to that, our protocol is a good example of modular design and can be instantiated with any secure OT scheme as well as other building blocks without reanalyzing security from scratch."

While there is no theoretical guarantee that deep learning (DL)-based solutions perform better than classic machine learning (ML)-based ones, DL-based models have become the common default. This paper compares well-known DL-based and ML-based models and shows that in the case of malicious traffic classification, state-of-the-art DL-based solutions do not necessarily outperform the classical ML-based ones. We exemplify this finding using two well-known datasets for a varied set of tasks, such as: malware detection, malware family classification, detection of zero-day attacks, and classification of an iteratively growing dataset. Note that, it is not feasible to evaluate all possible models to make a concrete statement, thus the above finding is not a recommendation to avoid DL-based models, but rather an empirical finding that in some cases, there are more simplistic solutions, that may perform even better. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
