In this Bitcoin trend analysis work, initial attributes are considered from five sectors based on financial, social, token, network, and that count to thirteen attributes. The thirteen attributes considered are price, volume, market cap, a mean dollar invested age, social volume, social dominance, development activity, transaction volume, token age consumed, token velocity, token circulation, market value to realized value, and realized cap. We apply the attribute selection and trend analysis mapped with potential seven attributes: Price, Volume, Market Cap, Social Dominance, Development Activity, Market Value to Realized Value & Realized Cap. We have conducted Nonlinear Autoregressive with External Input analysis considering seven attributes. The work employed three training algorithms to train a neural network as Levenberg-Marquard, Bayesian Regularization, and Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm. The Error histogram and regression plots results indicate that the Bayesian Regularized Neural Network is showing good performance and thus provides a better forecast."
a complete vader-based sentiment analysis of bitcoin (btc) tweets during the era of covid-19,"pano t., kashef r.",big data and cognitive computing,2020,10.3390/bdcc4040033,correlation; covid-19; sentiment analysis; twitter; vader scoring,34,Journal,Q2,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many research studies have been conducted to examine the impact of the outbreak on the financial sector, especially on cryptocurrencies. Social media, such as Twitter, plays a significant role as a meaningful indicator in forecasting the Bitcoin (BTC) prices. However, there is a research gap in determining the optimal preprocessing strategy in BTC tweets to develop an accurate machine learning prediction model for bitcoin prices. This paper develops different text preprocessing strategies for correlating the sentiment scores of Twitter text with Bitcoin prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the effect of different preprocessing functions, features, and time lengths of data on the correlation results. Out of 13 strategies, we discover that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices. The prices only correlate well with sentiment scores over shorter timespans. Selecting the optimum preprocessing strategy would prompt machine learning prediction models to achieve better accuracy as compared to the actual prices. © 2020 by the authors.

a deep learning-based cryptocurrency price prediction scheme for financial institutions,"patel m.m., tanwar s., gupta r., kumar n.",journal of information security and applications,2020,10.1016/j.jisa.2020.102583,cryptocurrency; gated recurrent unit; litecoin; long short-term memory; monero; price prediction; recurrent neural network; time series,54,Journal,Q2,"A cryptocurrency is a network-based digital exchange medium, where the records are secured using strong cryptographic algorithms such as Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) and Message Digest 5 (MD5). It uses blockchain technology to make the transactions secure, transparent, traceable, and immutable. Due to these properties, the cryptocurrencies have gained popularity in almost all the sectors especially in financial sectors. Though, cryptocurrencies are getting recognition form the approval bodies, but still, the uncertainty and dynamism in their prices risk the investments substantially. Cryptocurrency price prediction has become a trending research topic globally. Many machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Neural Networks (NN), and Long short-term memory (LSTM) have been used by the researchers to predict and analyze the factors affecting the cryptocurrency prices. In this paper, a LSTM and GRU-based hybrid cryptocurrency prediction scheme is proposed, which focuses on only two cryptocurrencies, namely Litecoin and Monero. The results depict that the proposed scheme accurately predicts the prices with high accuracy, revealing that the scheme can be applicable in various cryptocurrencies price predictions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
a dropout weight-constrained recurrent neural network model for forecasting the price of major cryptocurrencies and cci30 index,"livieris i.e., stavroyiannis s., pintelas e., kotsilieris t., pintelas p.",evolving systems,2022,10.1007/s12530-020-09361-2,cci30 index; cryptocurrency; dropout; forecasting; weight-constrained neural networks,4,Journal,Q2,"Cryptocurrency is widely recognized as an alternative method for paying and exchanging currency instead of using classic coins or gold; thus, it has infiltrated almost in all financial transactions worldwide. Nowadays, cryptocurrency trade constitutes one of the most popular and promising type of profitable investments. Nevertheless, this new and constantly increasing financial market is characterized by high volatility and strong fluctuations of prices over time. As a result, it is considered essential for portfolio optimization and management, the development of a forecasting model. In this work, we propose a new time-series model based on dropout weight-constrained recurrent neural networks for forecasting cryptocurrency prices and the value of Crypto-Currency index 30 (CCi30). The proposed forecasting model exploits advanced regularization techniques for reducing the fundamental problem of overfitting. More specifically, it is characterized by the imposition of box-constraints on the weights of the network for reducing the likelihood of them blowing up to unrealistic values. Additionally, the adoption of dropout technique aims to explore hard-reaching regions of the weight space and forces the weights to away from zero. The proposed forecasting model was evaluated against state-of-the-art types of neural networks and regression models for forecasting the price of the four most widely traded digital currencies and for the prediction of CCi30 index. Our conducted experimental and detailed statistical analysis demonstrate that although weight-constrained networks give significant improvements the adoption of dropout technique in weight-constrained networks provides a boost in increasing the forecasting performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature."
a new approach to predicting cryptocurrency returns based on the gold prices with support vector machines during the covid-19 pandemic using sensor-related data,"mahdi e., leiva v., mara’beh s., martin-barreiro c.",sensors,2021,10.3390/s21186319,artificial intelligence; data science; digital currency; gold; machine learning; sars-cov-2; sensing and data extraction,13,Journal,Q2,"In a real-world situation produced under COVID-19 scenarios, predicting cryptocurrency returns accurately can be challenging. Such a prediction may be helpful to the daily economic and financial market. Unlike forecasting the cryptocurrency returns, we propose a new approach to predict whether the return classification would be in the first, second, third quartile, or any quantile of the gold price the next day. In this paper, we employ the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for exploring the predictability of financial returns for the six major digital currencies selected from the list of top ten cryptocurrencies based on data collected through sensors. These currencies are Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Our study considers the pre-COVID-19 and ongoing COVID-19 periods. An algorithm that allows updated data analysis, based on the use of a sensor in the database, is also proposed. The results show strong evidence that the SVM is a robust technique for devising profitable trading strategies and can provide accurate results before and during the current pandemic. Our findings may be helpful for different stakeholders in understanding the cryptocurrency dynamics and in making better investment decisions, especially under adverse conditions and during times of uncertain environments such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

a quantum based evolutionary algorithm for stock index and bitcoin price forecasting,"amjad, u; jilani, ta; tariq, h; hussain, a",international journal of advanced computer science and applications,2018,,quantum evolutionary algorithm; fuzzy time series; nature inspired computing; fuzzy logic; crypto currency; bitcoin,1,Journal,Q3,"Quantum computing has emerged as a new dimension with various applications in different fields like robotic, cryptography, uncertainty modeling etc. On the other hand, nature inspired techniques are playing vital role in solving complex problems through evolutionary approach. While evolutionary approaches are good to solve stochastic problems in unbounded search space, predicting uncertain and ambiguous problems in real life is of immense importance. With improved forecasting accuracy many unforeseen events can be managed well. In this paper a novel algorithm for Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) prediction by using Quantum concepts is proposed in this paper. Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) is used along with fuzzy logic for prediction of time series data. QEA is applied on interval lengths for finding out optimized lengths of intervals producing best forecasting accuracy. The algorithm is applied for forecasting Taiwan Futures Exchange (TIAFEX) index as well as for Bitcoin crypto currency time series data as a new approach. Model results were compared with many preceding algorithms."

advanced social media sentiment analysis for short-term cryptocurrency price prediction,wołk k.,expert systems,2020,10.1111/exsy.12493,cryptocurrencies; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media; speculative models,22,Journal,Q3,"In recent years, the scrutiny of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal and regulated components of financial systems has been increasing. Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"
an optimized support vector machine (svm) based on particle swarm optimization (pso) for cryptocurrency forecasting,"hitam n.a., ismail a.r., saeed f.",procedia computer science,2019,10.1016/j.procs.2019.12.125,artificial intelligence; cryptocurrency; machine learning; particle swarm optimization; support vector machines,28,Conference,Journal - Unranked,"Forecasting accurate future price is very important in financial sector. An optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is introduced in forecasting the cryptocurrency future price. It is part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses previous experience to forecast future price. Analysts and investors generally combine fundamental and technical analysis prior to decide the best price to execute their trades. Some may use Machine Learning Algorithms to execute their trades. However, forecasting result using basic SVM algorithms does not really promising. On the other hands, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is known as a better algorithm for a static and simple optimization problem. Therefore, PSO is introduced to optimize the algorithms of SVM in cryptocurrency forecasting. The experiment of selected cryptocurrencies is conducted for this classifier. The experimental result demonstrates that an optimized SVM-PSO algorithm can effectively forecast the future price of cryptocurrency thus outperforms the single SVM algorithms. © 2019 The Authors.

astra: high throughput 3pc over rings with application to secure prediction,"chaudhari h., choudhury a., patra a., suresh a.",proceedings of the acm conference on computer and communications security,2019,10.1145/3338466.3358922,,29,Conference,CORE - A*,"The concrete eficiency of secure computation has been the focus of many recent works. In this work, we present concretely-eficient protocols for secure 3-party computation (3PC) over a ring of integers modulo 2 tolerating one corruption, both with semi-honest and malicious security. Owing to the fact that computation over ring emulates computation over the real-world system architectures, secure computation over ring has gained momentum of late. Cast in the offline-online paradigm, our constructions present the most eficient online phase in concrete terms. In the semi-honest setting, our protocol requires communication of 2 ring elements per multiplication gate during the online phase. In the malicious setting, our protocol requires communication of 4 elements per multiplication gate during the online phase, beating the state-of-the-art protocol by 5 elements. Realized with both the security notions of selective abort and fairness, the malicious protocol with fairness involves a slightly more communication than its counterpart with abort security for the output gates alone. We apply our techniques from 3PC in the regime of secure server-aided machine-learning (ML) inference for a range of prediction functions-linear regression, linear SVM regression, logistic regression, and linear SVM classification. Our setting considers a model-owner with trained model parameters and a client with a query, with the latter willing to learn the prediction of her query based on the model parameters of the former. The inputs and computation are outsourced to a set of three non-colluding servers. Our constructions catering to both semi-honest and malicious world, invariably perform better than the existing constructions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery."
bitcoin price forecasting with neuro-fuzzy techniques,"atsalakis g.s., atsalaki i.g., pasiouras f., zopounidis c.",european journal of operational research,2019,10.1016/j.ejor.2019.01.040,artificial intelligence; bitcoin price forecasting; fuzzy sets; neuro-fuzzy forecasting,95,Journal,Q1,"Cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being the most notable example, have attracted considerable attention in recent years, and they have experienced large fluctuations in their price. While a few studies employ conventional statistical and econometric approaches to reveal the driving factors of Bitcoin's prices, research on the development of forecasting models to be used as decision support tools in investment strategies is scarce. This study proposes a computational intelligence technique that uses a hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy controller, namely PATSOS, to forecast the direction in the change of the daily price of Bitcoin. The proposed methodology outperforms two other computational intelligence models, the first being developed with a simpler neuro-fuzzy approach, and the second being developed with artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the investment returns achieved by a trading simulation, based on the signals of the proposed model, are 71.21% higher than the ones achieved through a naive buy-and-hold strategy. The performance of the PATSOS system is robust to the use of other cryptocurrencies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Ability to understand which factors drive the fluctuations of the Bitcoin price and to what extent they are predictable is interesting both from the theoretical and practical perspective. In this paper, we study the problem of the Bitcoin short-term volatility forecasting based on volatility history and order book data. Order book, consisting of buy and sell orders over time, reflects the intention of the market and is closely related to the evolution of volatility. We propose temporal mixture models capable of adaptively exploiting both volatility history and order book features. By leveraging rolling and incremental learning and evaluation procedures, we demonstrate the prediction performance of our model as well as studying the robustness, in comparison to a variety of statistical and machine learning baselines. Meanwhile, our temporal mixture model enables to decipher the time-varying effect of order book features on volatility. It demonstrates the prospect of our temporal mixture model as an interpretable forecasting framework over heterogeneous Bitcoin data."

With increasing number of problems and complexities, there is requirement for more computational power, faster speed and better results. To overcome these computational barriers, quantum computers, which are based on principles of quantum mechanics were introduced. Faster computation is the main reason behind the evolution of quantum computers which is achieved by using quantum bits instead of bits as quantum bits store both the values 1 and 0 together in superposition. The article focuses on basics of quantum computing in brief and the underlying phenomenon behind quantum computers. Also this article exposes recent trends and the problems that are being faced in this quantum technology. The major impact of quantum machine learning is also discussed. The quantum machine learning is providing better application in this modern field. This article analyses the different research gaps and possible solutions in quantum computing.

cnn-based multivariate data analysis for bitcoin trend prediction,"cavalli s., amoretti m.",applied soft computing,2021,10.1016/j.asoc.2020.107065,blockchain; cnn; financial indicators; sentiment analysis,26,Journal,Q1,"Bitcoin is the most widely known blockchain, a distributed ledger that records an increasing number of transactions based on the bitcoin cryptocurrency. New bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that the demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Actually, the price is highly volatile, because it is affected by many factors including the supply of bitcoin, its market demand, the cost of the mining process, as well as economic and political world-class news. In this work, we illustrate a novel approach for bitcoin trend prediction, based on the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). First, we propose a methodology for building useful datasets that take into account social media data, the full blockchain transaction history, and a number of financial indicators. Moreover, we present a cloud-based system characterized by a highly efficient distributed architecture, which allowed us to collect a huge amount of data in order to build thousands of different datasets, using the aforementioned methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses 1D CNN for bitcoin trend prediction. Remarkably, an efficient and low-cost implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNN models that perform one-dimensional convolutions (i.e., scalar multiplications and additions). We show that the 1D CNN model we implemented, trained, validated and tested using the aforementioned datasets, allow one to predict the bitcoin trend with higher accuracy compared to LSTM models. Last but not least, we introduce and simulate a trading strategy based on the proposed 1D CNN model, which increases the profit when the bitcoin trend is bullish and reduces the loss when the trend is bearish. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

cryptocurrency volatility forecasting: a markov regime-switching midas approach,"ma f., liang c., ma y., wahab m.i.m.",journal of forecasting,2020,10.1002/for.2691,bitcoin; jump driven time-varying transition probabilities; markov-switching model; midas; realized variance,27,Journal,Q2,"The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate whether a novel Markov regime-switching mixed-data sampling (MRS-MIADS) model we design can improve the prediction accuracy of the realized variance (RV) of Bitcoin. Moreover, to verify whether the importance of jumps for RV forecasting changes over time, we extend the standard MIDAS model to characterize two volatility regimes and introduce a jump-driven time-varying transition probability between the two regimes. Our results suggest that the proposed novel MRS-MIDAS model exhibits statistically significant improvement for forecasting the RV of Bitcoin. In addition, we find that jump occurrences significantly increase the persistence of the high-volatility regime and switch between high- and low-volatility regimes. A wide range of checks confirm the robustness of our results. Finally, the proposed model shows significant improvement for 2-week and 1-month horizon forecasts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

It gives an edge over the traditional centralized methods as it provides decentralization, immutability, integrity, and anonymity. The most popular application of this technology is cryptocurrencies, which showed a massive rise in their popularity and market capitalization in recent years. Individual investors, big institutions, and corporate firms are investing heavily in it. However, the crypto market is less stable than traditional commodity markets. It can be affected by many technical, sentimental, and legal factors, so it is highly volatile, uncertain, and unpredictable. Plenty of research has been done on various cryptocurrencies to forecast accurate prices, but the majority of these approaches cannot be applied in real-time. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, in this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based hybrid model (includes Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) to predict the price of Litecoin and Zcash with inter-dependency of the parent coin. The proposed model can be used in real-time scenarios and it is well trained and evaluated using standard data sets.

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation. Further, to check the usability of DL-GuesS on other cryptocurrencies, we have also inferred results for price prediction of Bitcoin-Cash with the price history and tweets of Bitcoin-Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin. © 2013 IEEE."

The price data is accumulated from Poloniex exchange and analyzed through a Convolutional Neural Network and four types of Recurrent Neural Network including the Long Short Term Memory network, the Stacked Long Short Term Memory network, the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network, and the Gated Recurrent Unit network. These deep learning models are benchmarked and compared under various metrics.

In this work, we first collect the transaction data of Ethereum and build network models from a microlevel view and then use a link-prediction-based framework to quantify the impact of network characteristics on Ethereum evolution. Next, we explore the graph structure properties and the driving factors of newly generated transaction relationships. Experimental results show that the local and microscopic structure of Ethereum networks is star-shaped, and the transaction frequency of addresses has a great impact on the evolution of Ethereum transaction relationships. First-layer nodes of microstructures dominate the network evolution. Moreover, the degree of addresses is an effective basis for predicting the direction of new transactions.

Cryptocurrencies price behaviour is still largely unexplored, presenting new opportunities for researchers and economists to highlight similarities and differences with standard financial prices. We compared our results with various benchmarks: one recent work on Bitcoin prices forecasting that follows different approaches, a well-known paper that uses Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily NASDAQ closing prices spanning a 3-year interval and another, more recent paper which gives quantitative results on stock market index predictions. We followed different approaches in parallel, implementing both statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms: the Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model for uni-variate series forecast using only closing prices, and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for multivariate series using both price and volume data. We used two artificial neural networks as well: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). While the entire time series resulted to be indistinguishable from a random walk, the partitioning of datasets into shorter sequences, representing different price ""regimes"", allows to obtain precise forecast as evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) and relative Root Mean Square Error (relativeRMSE). In this case the best results are obtained using more than one previous price, thus confirming the existence of time regimes different from random walks.

However, despite some studies on potential economic determinants of Bitcoin price, a consensus on the best predictors is not reached yet. This paper investigates different predictors from various markets including Gold, Oil, S&P500, VIX, USDI, Ether and Ripple as well as Bitcoin historical price in predicting one-step-ahead Bitcoin returns. We propose a two-stage forecasting that comprises discrete wavelet transform as the decomposition method and a deep long short-term memory network as the forecasting algorithm. Beside analyzing forecasting for both univariate and multivariate regression, we design a simulated trading system to put the forecasts into practice and analyze the economic profitability of the predictors. In addition, we shed light on the black box method by implementing sensitivity analysis. To investigate the predictors’ efficacy through time and consider the effects of early 2018 price spike, the dataset is split into two periods: (1) prior to and including the spike and (2) after the spike. According to the experiments, it is hard to choose one predictor over the other in the first period. However, in the second period, Gold and Oil show the highest statistical accuracy, while S&P500 is the most profit-making predictor. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

In the early 1990's the so called Fuzzy Time Series were proposed to handle vague and imprecise knowledge in time series data and have since become competitive forecasting models. A common limitation of recent fuzzy time series models is their inability to handle non-stationary data. Thus, in this paper we introduce a Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series (NSFTS). In the proposed method, we employ Non-Stationary Fuzzy Sets, in which perturbation functions are used to adapt the membership function parameters in the knowledge base in response to statistical changes in the time series. The flexibility of the method by means of computational experiments was tested with eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several kinds of concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ SP500 and TAIEX), three real FOREX pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, GBP-USD), and two real cryptocoins exchange rates (Bitcoin-USD and Ethereum-USD). As competitor models the Time Variant fuzzy time series and the Incremental Ensemble were used, these are two of the major approaches for handling non-stationary data sets. The proposed method shows resilience to concept drift, by adapting parameters of the model, while preserving the symbolic structure of the knowledge base. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This factor makes them a popular choice for investors with an aim to get higher returns over a short span of time. The colossal high points and low points in digital forms of money costs have drawn in analysts from the scholarly community as well as ventures to foresee their costs. A few machines and deep learning algorithms like gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX), and a lot more have been utilized to exactly predict and investigate the elements influencing cryptocurrency prices.

However, Dash coin is an individual cryptocurrency, but it is derived from Bitcoin and Litecoin. The change in Bitcoin and Litecoin prices affects the Dash coin price. Motivated from these, we present a cryptocurrency price prediction framework in this paper. It acknowledges different cryptographic forms of money (which are subject to one another) as information and yields higher accuracy. To illustrate this concept, we have considered a price prediction of Dash coin through the past days' prices of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin as they have hierarchical dependency among them at the protocol level.

However, Bitcoin’s erratic behavior has discouraged some potential investors. To get insights into its behavior and price fluctuation, past studies have discovered the correlation between Twitter sentiments and Bitcoin behavior. Most of them have exclusively focused on their relationships, instead of the Twitter sentiment analysis itself. Finding the most suitable classification algorithms for sentiment analysis for this kind of data is challenging. For the enormous data in Twitter, the supervised sentiment analysis approach of unlabeled data can be time-consuming and expensive, which has been studied to be superior to unsupervised ones. As such, we propose the HyVADRF (hybrid valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner (VADER)–random forest) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) model. A semantic and rule-based VADER was used to calculate polarity scores and classify sentiments, which overcame the weakness of manual labeling, while a random forest was utilized as its supervised classifier. Furthermore, considering Twitter’s massive size, we collected over 3.6 million tweets and analyzed various dataset sizes as these are related to the model’s learning process. Lastly, GWO parameter tuning was conducted to optimize the classifier’s performance. The results show that 1) the HyVADRF model had an accuracy of 75.29%, precision of 70.22%, recall of 87.70%, and F1-score of 78%. 2) The most ideal dataset size percentage is 90% of the total collected tweets ( $n =1$ ,249,060). 3) The standard deviations are 0.0008 for accuracy and F1-score and 0.0011 for precision and recall.

The market microstructure for bitcoins is highly developed in terms of information generation and transfer. Therefore, returns volatility is highly likely to be affected by market information availability. We analyze the relationship between returns volatility and two independent variables, user opinion difference and user interest. This study adopted the GJR-GARCH model, appropriate for volatility studies. First, we find that, for volatility asymmetry, the Bitcoin market exhibits greater market efficiency than the general financial market. Also, the persistence of volatility is greater. The Bitcoin market is still relatively unregulated; hence, studying the relationship between information asymmetry and regulation in the market is salient. Moreover, we can infer that the ratio of reasonable users is high in the Bitcoin market. Second, the Bitcoin market supports the sequential information arrival hypothesis in that day trading volume, which is a proxy for user differences of opinion, has a statistically significant effect on returns volatility. Third, for the proxies of user interest, namely, the growth rate of page views on Google Trends and Wikipedia, only the growth rate of Google Trends shows statistically significant effects on Bitcoin returns volatility. This study can provide useful information to the financial market and policy makers on the behavior of the Bitcoin market, which may help to lower future entry barriers and opportunity costs of the Bitcoin market. © 2018"

The fraudsters could be both internal (operator of the scheme) and external (financial institutions (FI), such as banks, money-lenders, and insurance companies). The centrality of trust among stakeholders like PI, CF, and FI is a prime concern. Motivated from these facts, this paper proposes a decentralized framework, KaRuNa, A Blockchain-based Sentiment analysis framework for Fraud Cryptocurrency schemes. KaRuNa operates on public blockchain three phases of trust modeling among stakeholders. In the first phase, transactions are performed on the blockchain that offers trust, auditability, and transparency among stakeholders. In the second phase, sentiment analysis (SA) of cryptocurrencies is proposed based on a novel algorithm of hash addresses to generate classification scores (CS). Parameters like social trends, rise/fall in cryptocurrency price, measured standard deviation, peak and low are selected to fed to proposed novel Long-short term memory (LSTM) classifier to generate recommendations based on CS.

The increased use of machine learning techniques to predict time series and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments motivated the present study to seek more accurate predictions for the Bitcoin exchange rate. In this way, in a first stage of the proposed methodology, different feature selection techniques were evaluated in order to obtain the most relevant attributes for the predictions. In the sequence, it was analyzed the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble algorithms (based on Recurrent Neural Networks and the k-Means clustering method) for price direction predictions. Likewise, the ANN and SVM were employed for regression of the maximum, minimum and closing prices of the Bitcoin. Moreover, the regression results were also used as inputs to try to improve the price direction predictions. The results showed that the selected attributes and the best machine learning model achieved an improvement of more than 10%, in accuracy, for the price direction predictions, with respect to the state-of-the-art papers, using the same period of information.

The low barrier of entry and high data availability of the cryptocurrency market makes it an excellent subject of study, from which it is possible to derive insights into the behavior of markets through the application of sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques for the challenging task of stock market prediction. While there have been some previous studies, most of them have focused exclusively on the behavior of Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose the usage of common machine learning tools and available social media data for predicting the price movement of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin cryptocurrency market movements. We compare the utilization of neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) while using elements from Twitter and market data as input features. The results show that it is possible to predict cryptocurrency markets using machine learning and sentiment analysis, where Twitter data by itself could be used to predict certain cryptocurrencies and that NN outperform the other models. © 2019 by the authors."
project based learning: predicting bitcoin prices using deep learning,s. yogeshwaran; m. j. kaur; p. maheshwari,2019 ieee global engineering education conference (educon),2019,10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725091,project-based learning;bitcoin;blockchain;machine learning;svm;deep learning,13,Conference,IEEE Sponsored,"Project based learning is the methodology in which projects drive knowledge and is used in dedicated subjects without negotiating the coverage of the required technical material. This paper discusses the scheme and delivery of project based learning in computer science engineering as major project which adopts undergraduate creativities and emphasizes on real-world, open-ended projects. These projects foster a wide range of abilities, not only those related to content knowledge or technical skills, but also practical skills. The goal for this innovative undergrad project is to show how a trained machine model can predict the price of a cryptocurrency if we give the right amount of data and computational power. It displays a graph with the predicted values. The most popular technology is the kind of technological solution that could help mankind predict future events. With vast amount of data being generated and recorded on a daily basis, we have finally come close to an era where predictions can be accurate and be generated based on concrete factual data. Furthermore, with the rise of the crypto digital era more heads have turned towards the digital market for investments. This gives us the opportunity to create a model capable of predicting crypto currencies primarily Bitcoin. This can be accomplished by using a series of machine learning techniques and methodologies."
quantitative analysis of cryptocurrencies transaction graph,"motamed a.p., bahrak b.",applied network science,2019,10.1007/s41109-019-0249-6,blockchain; cryptocurrency; graph analysis; transaction graph,19,Journal,Q2,"Cryptocurrencies as a new way of transferring assets and securing financial transactions have gained popularity in recent years. Transactions in cryptocurrencies are publicly available, hence, statistical studies on different aspects of these currencies are possible. However, previous statistical analysis on cryptocurrencies transactions have been very limited and mostly devoted to Bitcoin, with no comprehensive comparison between these currencies. In this study, we intend to compare the transaction graph of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and Z-Cash, with respect to the dynamics of their transaction graphs over time, and discuss their properties. In particular, we observed that the growth rate of the nodes and edges of the transaction graphs, and the density of these graphs, are closely related to the price of these currencies. We also found that the transaction graph of these currencies is non-assortative, i.e. addresses do not tend for transact with a particular type of addresses of higher or lower degree, and the degree sequence of their transaction graph follows the power law distribution. © 2019, The Author(s)."
real-world model for bitcoin price prediction,"rathore r.k., mishra d., mehra p.s., pal o., hashim a.s., shapi'i a., ciano t., shutaywi m.",information processing and management,2022,10.1016/j.ipm.2022.102968,bitcoin; cryptocurrency; fbprophet model; machine learning; prediction; time series analysis,3,Journal,Q1,"Cryptocurrency is a new sort of digital asset that has evolved as a result of advances in financial technology, and it has provided a significant research opportunity. There are many algorithms for price prediction for crypto currencies like LSTM and ARIMA. However, the downside is that LSTM-based RNNs are difficult to comprehend, and gaining intuition into their behavior is tough. In order to produce decent outcomes, rigorous hyperparameter adjustment is also essential. Furthermore, crypto currencies do not precisely adhere to past data, and patterns change fast, reducing the accuracy of predictions. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Because the data is dynamic and heavily influenced by various seasons, the ARIMA model is unable to handle seasonal data. In order to provide better price predictions for crypto traders, a new model is required. The objective of the study is to apply Fbprophet model as the key model because it is superior in functionality as compared to LSTM and ARIMA additionally removing the pitfalls generated in LSTM and ARIMA model while analyzing the cryptocurrency data. This study provides a methodology for predicting the future price of bitcoin that does not rely solely on past data due to seasonality in historical data. So, after fitting the seasonality and smoothing, the model is constructed that can be useful for real-world use cases. In case of crypto currencies where less historical data is available and it is hard to find pattern, proposed method can easily deal this type of problems. Overall difference between predicted and actual values is low as compared to other model even after seasonal data was available. © 2022"
recommending cryptocurrency trading points with deep reinforcement learning approach,"sattarov o., muminov a., lee c.w., kang h.k., oh r., ahn j., oh h.j., jeon h.s.",applied sciences (switzerland),2020,10.3390/app10041506,day trading; deep reinforcement learning; double cross strategy; machine learning; moving average; position trading; scalping; swing trading; trading,16,Journal,Q2,"The net profit of investors can rapidly increase if they correctly decide to take one of these three actions: buying, selling, or holding the stocks. The right action is related to massive stock market measurements. Therefore, defining the right action requires specific knowledge from investors. The economy scientists, following their research, have suggested several strategies and indicating factors that serve to find the best option for trading in a stock market. However, several investors' capital decreased when they tried to trade the basis of the recommendation of these strategies. That means the stock market needs more satisfactory research, which can give more guarantee of success for investors. To address this challenge, we tried to apply one of the machine learning algorithms, which is called deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on the stock market. As a result, we developed an application that observes historical price movements and takes action on real-time prices. We tested our proposal algorithm with three-Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH)-crypto coins' historical data. The experiment on Bitcoin via DRL application shows that the investor got 14.4% net profits within one month. Similarly, tests on Litecoin and Ethereum also finished with 74% and 41% profit, respectively. © 2020 by the authors."
sentiment-driven price prediction of the bitcoin based on statistical and deep learning approaches,"serafini g., yi p., zhang q., brambilla m., wang j., hu y., li b.",proceedings of the international joint conference on neural networks,2020,10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206704,auto-regressive integrated moving average with exogenous input (arimax); bitcoin (btc); market stock prediction; recurrent neural network (rnn); sentiment analysis,10,Conference,CORE - B,"Nowadays, Bitcoin has become the most popular cryptocurrency, which gains the attention of investors and speculators alike. Asset pricing is a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders. Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model, we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario. © 2020 IEEE."
the best of two worlds: forecasting high frequency volatility for cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies with support vector regression,"peng y., albuquerque p.h.m., camboim de sá j.m., padula a.j.a., montenegro m.r.",expert systems with applications,2018,10.1016/j.eswa.2017.12.004,cryptocurrency; exchange rates; garch; machine learning; support vector machines; volatility forecasting,129,Journal,Q1,"This paper provides an evaluation of the predictive performance of the volatility of three cryptocurrencies and three currencies with recognized stores of value using daily and hourly frequency data. We combined the traditional GARCH model with the machine learning approach to volatility estimation, estimating the mean and volatility equations using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and comparing to GARCH family models. Furthermore, the models’ predictive ability was evaluated using Diebold-Mariano test and Hansen's Model Confidence Set. The analysis was reiterated for both low and high frequency data. Results showed that SVR-GARCH models managed to outperform GARCH, EGARCH and GJR-GARCH models with Normal, Student's t and Skewed Student's t distributions. For all variables and both time frequencies, the SVR-GARCH model exhibited statistical significance towards its superiority over GARCH and its extensions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
time series classification of cryptocurrency price trend based on a recurrent lstm neural network,"kwon, dh; kim, jb; heo, js; kim, cm; han, yh",journal of information processing systems,2019,10.3745/JIPS.03.0120,classification; gradient boosting; long short-term memory; time series analysis,21,Journal,Q3,"In this study, we applied the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to classify the cryptocurrency price time series. We collected historic cryptocurrency price time series data and preprocessed them in order to make them clean for use as train and target data. After such preprocessing, the price time series data were systematically encoded into the three-dimensional price tensor representing the past price changes of cryptocurrencies. We also presented our LSTM model structure as well as how to use such price tensor as input data of the LSTM model. In particular, a grid search-based k-fold cross-validation technique was applied to find the most suitable LSTM model parameters. Lastly, through the comparison of the f1-score values, our study showed that the LSTM model outperforms the gradient boosting model, a general machine learning model known to have relatively good prediction performance, for the time series classification of the cryptocurrency price trend. With the LSTM model, we got a performance improvement of about 7% compared to using the GB model."

what drives cryptocurrency prices? an investigation of google trends and telegram sentiment,smuts n.,performance evaluation review,2019,10.1145/3308897.3308955,bitcoin; cryptocurrency; ethereum; google trends; lstm; sentiment; telegram,20,Conference,Journal - Unranked,"The Google Trends 1 search analysis service and the Telegram 2 messaging platform are investigated to determine their respective relationships to cryptocurrency price behaviour. It is shown that, in contrast to earlier findings, the relationship between cryptocurrency price movements and internet search volumes obtained from Google Trends is no longer consistently positive, with strong negative correlations detected for Bitcoin and Ethereum during June 2018. Sentiment extracted from cryptocurrency investment groups on Telegram is found to be positively correlated to Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements, particularly during periods of elevated volatility. The number of messages posted on a Bitcoin-themed Telegram group is found to be an indicator of Bitcoin price action in the subsequent week. A long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is developed to predict the direction of cryptocurrency prices using data obtained from Google Trends and Telegram. It is shown that Telegram data is a better predictor of the direction of the Bitcoin market than Google Trends. The converse is true for Ethereum. The LSTM model produces the most accurate results when predicting price movements over a one-week period. Copyright is held by author/owner(s)."
