In this Bitcoin trend analysis work, initial attributes are considered from five sectors based on financial, social, token, network, and that count to thirteen attributes. The thirteen attributes considered are price, volume, market cap, a mean dollar invested age, social volume, social dominance, development activity, transaction volume, token age consumed, token velocity, token circulation, market value to realized value, and realized cap. We apply the attribute selection and trend analysis mapped with potential seven attributes: Price, Volume, Market Cap, Social Dominance, Development Activity, Market Value to Realized Value & Realized Cap. We have conducted Nonlinear Autoregressive with External Input analysis considering seven attributes. The work employed three training algorithms to train a neural network as Levenberg-Marquard, Bayesian Regularization, and Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm. The Error histogram and regression plots results indicate that the Bayesian Regularized Neural Network is showing good performance and thus provides a better forecast."

Bitcoin is a very secure, decentralized, peer to peer currency with no third-party involvement. The price prediction of Bitcoin in the following years is a difficult task. The objective is to take a dig in the prediction of the future prices, dealing with real world data. A comparative study of the results produced by different machine learning models, along with graphs for epoch vs price, error and accuracy for each model using both linear and non-linear functions is done. We are using both neural network algorithms, such as artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), as well as some famous supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), to form the analysis. The time price prediction graphs and the epoch loss accuracy graphs are used for the analysis of each algorithm working on the same data and produces different results. Finally, the best suited algorithm are used for the prediction of future Bitcoin price."
a complete vader-based sentiment analysis of bitcoin (btc) tweets during the era of covid-19,"pano t., kashef r.",big data and cognitive computing,2020,10.3390/bdcc4040033,correlation; covid-19; sentiment analysis; twitter; vader scoring,34,Journal,Q2,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many research studies have been conducted to examine the impact of the outbreak on the financial sector, especially on cryptocurrencies. Social media, such as Twitter, plays a significant role as a meaningful indicator in forecasting the Bitcoin (BTC) prices. However, there is a research gap in determining the optimal preprocessing strategy in BTC tweets to develop an accurate machine learning prediction model for bitcoin prices. This paper develops different text preprocessing strategies for correlating the sentiment scores of Twitter text with Bitcoin prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the effect of different preprocessing functions, features, and time lengths of data on the correlation results. Out of 13 strategies, we discover that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices. The prices only correlate well with sentiment scores over shorter timespans. Selecting the optimum preprocessing strategy would prompt machine learning prediction models to achieve better accuracy as compared to the actual prices. © 2020 by the authors.

LSTM and GRU models are trained and tested on the same hyperparameter configuration while increasing the number of epochs from 1 to 30. The accuracy of each model is measured by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). As a result of comparing GRU and LSTM, in BTC and ETH, the GRU was more advantageous for the downward stabilization trend, and the LSTM was suitable for the upward stabilization trend. However, in case of low-priced LTC, LSTM and GRU showed the same performance in sample type A, and in the case of type B, GRU was more accurate. © 2021 IEEE."

a deep learning-based action recommendation model for cryptocurrency profit maximization,"park j., seo y.-s.",electronics (switzerland),2022,10.3390/electronics11091466,bitcoin; bitcoin price prediction; cryptocurrency; decision making; deep learning; input feature; profit,1,Journal,Q2,"Research on the prediction of cryptocurrency prices has been actively conducted, as cryptocurrencies have attracted considerable attention. Recently, researchers have aimed to improve the performance of price prediction methods by applying deep learning-based models. However, most studies have focused on predicting cryptocurrency prices for the following day. Therefore, clients are inconvenienced by the necessity of rapidly making complex decisions on actions that support maximizing their profit, such as “Sell”, “Buy”, and “Wait”. Furthermore, very few studies have explored the use of deep learning models to make recommendations for these actions, and the performance of such models remains low. Therefore, to solve these problems, we propose a deep learning model and three input features: sellProfit, buyProfit, and maxProfit. Through these concepts, clients are provided with criteria on which action would be most beneficial at a given current time. These criteria can be used as decision-making indices to facilitate profit maximization. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, daily price data of six representative cryptocurrencies were used to conduct an experiment. The results confirm that the proposed model showed approximately 13% to 21% improvement over existing methods and is statistically significant. © 2022 by the authors.

It uses blockchain technology to make the transactions secure, transparent, traceable, and immutable. Due to these properties, the cryptocurrencies have gained popularity in almost all the sectors especially in financial sectors. Though, cryptocurrencies are getting recognition form the approval bodies, but still, the uncertainty and dynamism in their prices risk the investments substantially. Cryptocurrency price prediction has become a trending research topic globally. Many machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Neural Networks (NN), and Long short-term memory (LSTM) have been used by the researchers to predict and analyze the factors affecting the cryptocurrency prices. In this paper, a LSTM and GRU-based hybrid cryptocurrency prediction scheme is proposed, which focuses on only two cryptocurrencies, namely Litecoin and Monero. The results depict that the proposed scheme accurately predicts the prices with high accuracy, revealing that the scheme can be applicable in various cryptocurrencies price predictions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
a dropout weight-constrained recurrent neural network model for forecasting the price of major cryptocurrencies and cci30 index,"livieris i.e., stavroyiannis s., pintelas e., kotsilieris t., pintelas p.",evolving systems,2022,10.1007/s12530-020-09361-2,cci30 index; cryptocurrency; dropout; forecasting; weight-constrained neural networks,4,Journal,Q2,"Cryptocurrency is widely recognized as an alternative method for paying and exchanging currency instead of using classic coins or gold; thus, it has infiltrated almost in all financial transactions worldwide. Nowadays, cryptocurrency trade constitutes one of the most popular and promising type of profitable investments. Nevertheless, this new and constantly increasing financial market is characterized by high volatility and strong fluctuations of prices over time. As a result, it is considered essential for portfolio optimization and management, the development of a forecasting model. In this work, we propose a new time-series model based on dropout weight-constrained recurrent neural networks for forecasting cryptocurrency prices and the value of Crypto-Currency index 30 (CCi30). The proposed forecasting model exploits advanced regularization techniques for reducing the fundamental problem of overfitting. More specifically, it is characterized by the imposition of box-constraints on the weights of the network for reducing the likelihood of them blowing up to unrealistic values. Additionally, the adoption of dropout technique aims to explore hard-reaching regions of the weight space and forces the weights to away from zero. The proposed forecasting model was evaluated against state-of-the-art types of neural networks and regression models for forecasting the price of the four most widely traded digital currencies and for the prediction of CCi30 index. Our conducted experimental and detailed statistical analysis demonstrate that although weight-constrained networks give significant improvements the adoption of dropout technique in weight-constrained networks provides a boost in increasing the forecasting performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature."
a forecasting approach to cryptocurrency price index using reinforcement learning,"mariappan l.t., pandian j.a., kumar v.d., geman o., chiuchisan i., năstase c.",applied sciences (switzerland),2023,10.3390/app13042692,bitcoin; blockchain; forecasting; mortgage lender; reinforcement learning,0,Journal,Q3,"Cryptocurrency has emerged as a well-known significant component with both economic and financial potential in recent years. Unfortunately, Bitcoin acquisition is not simple, due to uneven business and significant rate fluctuations.

We recommended a machine learning-based alternative for a mortgage lender based on highlighted problems in forecasting the price of Bitcoin. The proposed system included a reinforcement learning algorithm for price estimation and forecasting, as well as a blockchain framework for an efficient and secure environment. The proposed prediction, compared to other state-of-the-art strategies in this sector, demonstrated better performance.

a hybrid model integrating lstm and garch for bitcoin price prediction,z. gao; y. he; e. e. kuruoglu,2021 ieee 31st international workshop on machine learning for signal processing (mlsp),2021,10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596429,non-stationary time series analysis;cryptocurrency prediction;bitcoin;long short-term memory(lstm);garch,0,Conference,IEEE Sponsored,"Due to the nonlinearity and highly volatile dynamics of the price data of cryptocurrency, classic parametric models show limited success in tracking and prediction. With the rise of deep learning recently, various researches on forecasting the price of cryptocurrency using deep neural network have reported encouraging results in the cases of low volatility. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach which combines the advantages of non-stationary parametric models such as Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) with the nonlinear modelling potential of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The results show that our hybrid model has a similar predictive performance in terms of MSE, MAE and RMSE but higher metric scores in precision, accuracy and F1 score under optimal hyperparameters. This study reveals that the combination of parametric models like GARCH with deep neural network may come up with better results in cryptocurrency price forecasting especially in the case of highly volatile data or when short data sequences are available. Moreover, the proposed framework can be used also in other applications where high volatility and scarcity of data are the main characteristics."

While conventional financial machine learning methods try to predict the price trends, reinforcement learning based portfolio management methods makes trading decisions according to the price changes directly. However, existing reinforcement learning based methods are limited in extracting the price change information at single-scale level, which makes their performance still not satisfactory. In this paper, inspired by the Inception network that has achieved great success in computer vision and can extract multi-scale features simultaneously, we propose a novel Ensemble of Identical Independent Inception (EI3) convolutional neural network, with the objective of addressing the limitation of existing reinforcement learning based portfolio management methods. With EI3, multiple assets can be processed independently while sharing the same network parameters. Moreover, price movement information for each product can be extracted at multiple scales via wide network and then aggregated to make trading decision. Based on EI3, we further propose a recurrent reinforcement learning framework to provide a deep machine learning solution for the portfolio management problem. Comprehensive experiments on the cryptocurrency datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing competitors, in both upswing and downswing environments."
a new approach to predicting cryptocurrency returns based on the gold prices with support vector machines during the covid-19 pandemic using sensor-related data,"mahdi e., leiva v., mara’beh s., martin-barreiro c.",sensors,2021,10.3390/s21186319,artificial intelligence; data science; digital currency; gold; machine learning; sars-cov-2; sensing and data extraction,13,Journal,Q2,"In a real-world situation produced under COVID-19 scenarios, predicting cryptocurrency returns accurately can be challenging. Such a prediction may be helpful to the daily economic and financial market. Unlike forecasting the cryptocurrency returns, we propose a new approach to predict whether the return classification would be in the first, second, third quartile, or any quantile of the gold price the next day. In this paper, we employ the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for exploring the predictability of financial returns for the six major digital currencies selected from the list of top ten cryptocurrencies based on data collected through sensors. These currencies are Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Our study considers the pre-COVID-19 and ongoing COVID-19 periods. An algorithm that allows updated data analysis, based on the use of a sensor in the database, is also proposed. The results show strong evidence that the SVM is a robust technique for devising profitable trading strategies and can provide accurate results before and during the current pandemic. Our findings may be helpful for different stakeholders in understanding the cryptocurrency dynamics and in making better investment decisions, especially under adverse conditions and during times of uncertain environments such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

a new hybrid cryptocurrency returns forecasting method based on multiscale decomposition and an optimized extreme learning machine using the sparrow search algorithm,"du, xx; tang, zp; wu, jc; chen, kj; cai, y",ieee access,2022,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3179364,predictive models; cryptocurrency; forecasting; data models; prediction algorithms; time series analysis; solid modeling; cryptocurrency; model selection; decomposition-ensemble; extreme learning machine; sparrow search algorithm,0,Journal,Q1,"The return series of cryptocurrencies, which are emerging digital assets, exhibit nonstationarity, nonlinearity, and volatility clustering compared to other traditional financial markets, making them exceptionally difficult to forecast. Therefore, accurate cryptocurrency price forecasting is essential for market participants and regulators. It has been demonstrated that improved data forecasting accuracy can be achieved through decomposition, but few researchers have performed information extraction on the residual series generated by data decomposition. Based on the construction of a decomposition-optimization-integration hybrid model framework, in this paper, we propose a multi-scale hybrid forecasting model that combines the residual components after primary decomposition for secondary decomposition and integration. This model uses the variational modal decomposition (VMD) method to decompose the original return series into a finite number of components and residual terms. Then, the residual terms are decomposed, and the features are extracted using the completed ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) method. The components are predicted by an extreme learning machine optimized by the sparrow search algorithm, and the final predictions are summed to obtain the final results. Forecasts for the returns of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are significant cryptocurrency assets, are compared with other benchmark models constructed based on different ideas. We find that the proposed quadratic decomposition VMD-Res.-CEEMDAN-SSA-ELM hybrid model demonstrates the optimal and most stable forecasting performance in both one-step and multi-step ahead prediction of the cryptocurrency return series."

Firstly, this paper presents a study of the severe drawbacks of all existing literature on FTS. In particular, this article outlines severe shortcomings of all existing FTS based algorithms that caused inaccuracies among all existing FTS-based algorithms in yielding meaningful prediction. Then, a novel structure of our improvised FTS, denoted as QFTS, is presented in this paper, which aims to rectify all flaws exist in all conventional FTS based models in literature. A further hybrid of QFTS with ANN is also presented. Later, a comparative analysis of all the aforementioned FTS models is presented in terms of overall forecasting accuracy and forecasting accuracy under specific conditions. The results are being compared in terms of MAPE. The newly invented QFTS model and the QFTS-ANN hybrid is found to profoundly outperform all the existing FTS models in literature, which includes Singh's FTS model.

Different machine learning-based models have been integrated, and a combined prediction model has been created. The objective of the ensemble model is that it must outperform all other individual models that are used to construct the ensemble model in terms of producing excellent predictions. The field of cryptocurrencies has been selected as the domain of this work where the focus is to predict the cryptocurrency prices using the proposed model. A new regression model is proposed and implemented in this work. Different machine learning techniques have been adopted and integrated to form a combined prediction model. The machine learning models include deep neural networks, support vector regression, and decision trees. The regression scheme has to be implemented on each machine learning model separately as well as their performance is also to be improved. The combined prediction model requires optimal weights generation for integration, and therefore, time complexity is a concern. A large set of experiments have been carried out on various cryptocurrencies and the results are displayed. Real-world data has been used here and a comparison is also performed. It is observed that the combined prediction model outperforms other models resulting in excellent predictions capturing most of the nonstationary movements in the data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (narx) neural network model for the prediction of timestamp influence on bitcoin value,n. aljojo; a. alshutayri; e. aldhahri; s. almandeel; a. zainol,ieee access,2021,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124629,bitcoin (digital currency);volume of btc;bitcoin;timestamp,0,Journal,Q1,"The transaction and market of bitcoin is volatile, meaning itâs uncertain because it changes frequently. There have been a number of research studies that have presented bitcoin price prediction models, but none of them have looked at the controlling variables linked with bitcoin transaction timestamps. It might be that price is not the only key criteria influencing bitcoin transactions, or the available model for bitcoin price prediction is yet to consider timestamp as a determining factor in its transaction. A better and more accurate model would be required to predict how the Timestamp influences changes of bitcoin transactions. That is why this current study utilized a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the prediction of timestamp influence on Bitcoin value. Bitcoin historical datasets which are converted to a nonlinear regression into a âwell-formulatedâ statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression are used. Simulation analysis indicates that bitcoin digital currencyâs performance variation is highly influenced by its transaction timestamp with the prediction accuracy of 96%. The contributions of this research lies with the fact that specific Bitcoin transaction events repeat themselves over and over again, meaning that the Open-Price, High-Price, Low-Price, and Close-Price of Bitcoin price over timestamp developed a pattern that was predicted by NARX with less That means those involved in the transaction of bitcoin at the wrong timestamp will certainly face the uncertainty negative effect of the bitcoin market."

In this context, we proposed several models’ architectures for price prediction. Among them, we proposed a hybrid one that incorporates long short-term memory (LSTM) and Convolution neural network (CNN) architectures, we called it CNN-LSTM. The proposed CNN-LSTM model makes use of the characteristics of the convolution layers for extracting useful features embedded in the time series data and the ability of LSTM architecture to learn long-term dependencies. The proposed architectures are thoroughly evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art methods on three different types of financial product datasets for stocks, foreign exchange instruments, and cryptocurrency.

In such an anonymous environment, the large number of entities using Bitcoin, and the huge scale of the Bitcoin trading network make it difficult for users to have a rough idea of the entire trading network before transaction. Thus, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to summarize the research problems, achievements and possible research trends based on Bitcoin data analysis. Therefore, in this paper we review the literatures about data analysis on Bitcoin transaction entities. Starting from the relevant conceptual framework of Bitcoin, this paper divides the existing research models into three categories, heuristic algorithm identification of entities, transaction descriptive statistics and network analysis, and visual system analysis. By analyzing the transaction entity, Bitcoin transaction data can be processed in a manner which is similar to an account, such as a bank or credit card, thereby achieving the purpose of in-depth analysis of all transaction activities related to the account entity.

Real-time big data streaming analytics is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a streaming big data architecture for real-time social network analysis. As a case study, we investigated the relation between the public opinions on social media about cryptocurrencies and the changes in their prices using lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches with the goal of assessing the feasibility of predicting the prices of cryptocurrencies. Two different approaches with two lexicons were used for sentiment analysis score calculations to assess the consistency of correlation measures on the collected dataset. Our model indicates that the prediction of cryptocurrency price changes using lexicon-based sentiment analysis methods is not reliable. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."

a temporal graph framework for intelligence extraction in social media networks,"chung w., lai v.s.",information and management,2023,10.1016/j.im.2023.103773,github; modeling; primacy; psychological theory; recency; social media analytics; social media networks; social theory,0,Journal,Q1,"Social media networks (SMNs) are increasingly used in professional management of knowledge workers and related assets. However, the factors affecting behavioral trends and activity levels in these networks are not well understood. Although social and cognitive theories can help to explain human behavior in traditional social networks, their application to SMNs has not been validated. Traditional social network modeling techniques may not accurately predict real-world SMN activities. This research developed a temporal graph framework for intelligence extraction in SMNs. Theory-based, data-driven models (Conformity Model (COM), Recency-Primacy Model (REM), Trend Interaction Model (TIM), Periodic Interaction Model (PIM)) were developed based on the framework to capture various aspects of user behavior: conformity effect, recency, primacy, periodicity, and dynamic trend. The models capture the activity history and dynamically combine pricing information to enhance predictive accuracy. Using data of 83,536 GitHub software repositories on cryptocurrency, this article reports the results of experiments that compare the models’ performance in predicting SMN activities over time. Experimental results show that the model (REM) that captures recency/primacy effects of human cognitive processing outperformed other models in 9 (out of 18) measures pertaining to engagement, contribution, influence, and popularity. Primacy plays a dominant role in predicting engagement, contribution, and popularity, whereas recency plays a key role in predicting influence. Short-term trend (modeled with TIM) was found to yield significantly better performance on predicting user contribution. The models also outperformed an integrated machine learning (IML) model by most measures. Overall, the effects modeled by REM and TIM were found to be more significant than the effects modeled by COM, PIM, and IML. The research contributes to enhancing understanding of SMN behavior, developing new models to simulate and predict SMN activities, and designing new artifacts for information systems practitioners to manage knowledge assets and to extract SMN intelligence. © 2023"

This study constructs time-series models to examine DeFi-and NFT-related cryptocurrencies and to clarify how their weekly prices fluctuated over a one-year period. Using Google Trends data, we measure how weekly Internet searches into crypto markets generally and specific branded cryptocurrencies affected price fluctuations for each coin.

adaptive fuzzy modeling of interval-valued stream data and application in cryptocurrencies prediction,"maciel, l; ballini, r; gomide, f",neural computing & applications,-1,10.1007/s00521-021-06263-5,adaptive machine learning; fuzzy modeling; interval-valued stream data; forecasting; cryptocurrencies,3,Journal,Q2,"This paper introduces an adaptive interval fuzzy modeling method using participatory learning and interval-valued stream data. The model is a collection of fuzzy functional rules in which the rule base structure and the parameters of the rules evolve simultaneously as data are input. The evolving nature of the method allows continuous model adaptation using the stream interval input data. The method employs participatory learning to cluster the interval input data recursively, constructs a fuzzy rule for each cluster, uses the weighted recursive least squares to update the parameters of the rule consequent intervals, and returns an interval-valued output. The method is evaluated using actual data to model and forecast the daily lowest and highest prices of the four most traded cryptocurrencies, BitCoin, Ethereum, XRP, and LiteCoin. The performance of the adaptive interval fuzzy modeling is compared with the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, long short-term memory neural network, autoregressive integrated moving average, exponential smoothing state model, and the naive random walk methods. Results show that the suggested interval fuzzy model outperforms all these methods in predicting prices in the digital coin market, especially when considering directional accuracy measure."
advanced social media sentiment analysis for short-term cryptocurrency price prediction,wołk k.,expert systems,2020,10.1111/exsy.12493,cryptocurrencies; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media; speculative models,22,Journal,Q3,"In recent years, the scrutiny of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal and regulated components of financial systems has been increasing. Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"
an asymptotic statistical learning algorithm for prediction of key trading events,"yin j., wang r., ju s., bai y., huang j.z.",ieee intelligent systems,2020,10.1109/MIS.2020.2977590,asymptotic statistical learning; key trading events; monotonic measure; random event prediction,3,Journal,Q1,"In financial trading, trading at key time points (i.e., the best times for buying or selling in specific contexts) is one of the most effective trading methods. Since key points are random and sparse, their randomness needs to be investigated to predict key points reliably. Based on measure theory, we propose an event mapping model to formally define this randomness and express it in a low dimensional and normalized space Q through mapping functions. Interestingly, when mapping functions are monotonic, the probability of a key event can be approximated by those of nested random events in Q. Based on this finding, we designed a long short-term memory based neural network to learn the mapping functions and derived an asymptotic statistical learning (ASL) algorithm. ASL automatically analyzes the convergence of random events in space Q and makes point estimates on key events in trading. Compared with 12 existing algorithms on six real datasets from NYSE, S&P 500, NASDAQ, cryptocurrency markets, etc., the algorithm ASL reliably predicts sparse key events from many random events, which provides a method to deal with the imbalance classification problem in predicting key events in trading. ASL significantly outperforms other algorithms under different market situations in both bull and bear markets. © 2001-2011 IEEE."

While this highly volatile market offers great profit opportunities to investors, it also brings risks due to its sensitivity to speculative news and the unpredictable behaviour of major investors that can cause unsual price movements. In this paper, we argue that rapid and high price fluctuations or unusual patterns that occur in this way may negatively affect the functionality of technical signals that constitute a basis for feature extraction in a machine learning (ML)-based trading system and this may cause the generalization of the model to deteriorate. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end ML-based trading system including a time series outlier detection module that detects the periods in which unusual price formations are observed. The training of the classification algorithms for the price direction prediction task was performed on the remaining data. We present the results related to the accuracy of the classification models as well as the simulation results obtained using the proposed system for real time trading on the historical data. The findings showed that the outlier detection step significantly increases return on investment for the machine learning-based trading strategies. Besides, the results showed that during the highly volatile periods the trading system becomes more profitable compared to the baseline model and buy&hold strategy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

The limited supply, high volatility, and random price fluctuations have increased investors' interest in BTC, especially in daily trading. Although BTC has been yielding a high rate of returns, price fluctuations and constant speculations make the investors wary of unexpected price movements. Predictive modeling suffers from the complexity of the datasets (i.e., the high number of features employed to forecast BTC movements) as well as the black-box nature of most machine learning algorithms (which is especially problematic for corporate investors since they are obligated to disclose their investment decisions to their clients). Therefore, the main goal of the current study is to assist individual and corporate investors in making transparent and interpretable daily BTC trading decisions by developing a predictive analytics framework. To address the complexities posed by the datasets, a comprehensive tri-level feature selection approach is proposed. The selected features are then, fed into the Classification & Regression Tree (C&RT) to build a highly parsimonious, transparent, and interpretable prediction model. The resultant model was not only evaluated on the test (holdout) sample but was also tested on challenging time periods, including the first half of 2020 (the start of the pandemic era) to exhibit the viability and reliability of the proposed framework. Finally, a decision support tool is developed for the practical implementation of the model. The tool can be used by short-term investors not only due to its highly simplistic, transparent, and interpretable structure, but also its higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity results when compared to the extant literature. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

This study ex-periments with three different time series forecasting methods, specifically considered for Cryptocurrencies price such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR) and Cardano (XRP), and devises a procedure to evaluate their performance. Time series data are collected and examined using descriptive statistics. In next step, the White Neural Network is used for Non-Linearity and Dickey-Fuller for nonstationary and correlation among different settings of datasets. Based on these analyses, we evaluate efficient financial forecasting models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric, Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal (TBATS) and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) with reference to different parameters configuration of these models. The performance is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) criterion and models are ranked by statistical mean and standard deviation of MAPE values. The NNAR model gives minimum MAPE of 2.823 while the minimum convergence time of 4.9835s is observed with TBATS and hence, these are ranked at top amongst other models respectively. These results underpin that neural network-based models perform equally well on both types of nonlinear and linear financial data and, thus, have the potential to improve the impact of financial transaction and cryptocurrencies price bringing more innovation in the decision making process. © 2022 IEEE."

For our experiments, we extracted semantic information and user statistics from over 30 million Bitcoin-related tweets, in conjunction with 15-minute frequency price data over a horizon of 144 days. Using this data, we built several deep learning architectures that utilized different combinations of the gathered information. For each model, we conducted ablation studies to assess the influence of different components and feature sets over the prediction accuracy. We found statistical evidences for the hypotheses that: (i) temporal convolutional networks perform significantly better than both classical autoregressive models and other deep learning-based architectures in the literature, and (ii) tweet author meta-information, even detached from the tweet itself, is a better predictor of volatility than the semantic content and tweet volume statistics.

In this work, we present concretely-eficient protocols for secure 3-party computation (3PC) over a ring of integers modulo 2 tolerating one corruption, both with semi-honest and malicious security. Owing to the fact that computation over ring emulates computation over the real-world system architectures, secure computation over ring has gained momentum of late. Cast in the offline-online paradigm, our constructions present the most eficient online phase in concrete terms. In the semi-honest setting, our protocol requires communication of 2 ring elements per multiplication gate during the online phase. In the malicious setting, our protocol requires communication of 4 elements per multiplication gate during the online phase, beating the state-of-the-art protocol by 5 elements. Realized with both the security notions of selective abort and fairness, the malicious protocol with fairness involves a slightly more communication than its counterpart with abort security for the output gates alone. We apply our techniques from 3PC in the regime of secure server-aided machine-learning (ML) inference for a range of prediction functions-linear regression, linear SVM regression, logistic regression, and linear SVM classification. Our setting considers a model-owner with trained model parameters and a client with a query, with the latter willing to learn the prediction of her query based on the model parameters of the former.

Due to this, sentiment analysis of the cryptocurrency-related comments has become highly desirable to give a comprehensive picture of peoples' opinions about the trend of the market. In this regard, we perform cryptocurrency-related text sentiment classification using tweets based on positive and negative sentiments. For increasing the efficacy of the sentiment analysis, we introduce a novel deep neural network hybrid architecture which is composed of an embedding layer, a convolution layer, a group-wise enhancement mechanism, a bidirectional layer, an attention mechanism, and a fully connected layer. Local features are derived using a convolution layer, and weight values associated with intuitive features are developed using the group-wise enhancement mechanism. After feeding the improved context vector to the bidirectional layer to grab global features, the attention mechanism and the fully connected layer have been employed. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art architectures with an accuracy value of 93.77%."

Since its inception, in a short period of time Bitcoin got wide popularity and considered as an investment asset. At present it is the most successful cryptocurrency compared to other altcoins dispersed in the world economy. The Bitcoin prices fluctuate like other stock markets due to inherent volatility. The investors’ confidence on Bitcoin rising fast and have been reflected on its prices. Though few computational intelligence methods are available, sophisticated methodologies for accurate prediction of Bitcoin are still lacking and need to be explored. Functional link neural network (FLN) is a flat network, offers lower computational complexity, and achieves enhanced input–output nonlinearity mapping through functional expansion of input signals. Basis functions such as Legendre, Trigonometric, Laguerre, and Chebyshev are commonly used polynomials in FLN for expansion of input signal dimension. In this article along with the weight and bias vector of FLNs, optimal number of polynomial functions for each category of basis function is selected by genetic algorithm during training process rather fixing them earlier. Therefore, an optimal FLN structure is crafted on fly from exploitation of training data. The optimal FLN models are used to predict the daily, weekly, and monthly closing prices of Bitcoin. A comparative study among optimal FLNs is carried out using evaluation metrics such as MAPE, NMSE, ARV, and U of Theil’s statistics. Finally, outcomes from experimental and comparative studies suggested the superiority of optimal FLN models for Bitcoin closing price prediction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Predicting the future value of bitcoin can help investors to make more educated decisions and to provide authorities with a point of reference for evaluating cryptocurrency. The novelty of the proposed prediction models lies in the use of artificial intelligence to identify movement cryptocurrency prices, particularly bitcoin prices. A forecasting model that can accurately and reliably predict the market’s volatility and price variations is necessary for portfolio management and optimization in this continually expanding financial market. In this paper, we investigate a time series analysis that makes use of deep learning to investigate volatility and provide an explanation for this behavior. Our findings have managerial ramifications, such as the potential for developing a product for investors. This can help to expand upon our model by adjusting various hyperparameters to produce a more accurate model for predicting the price of cryptocurrencies. Another possible managerial implication of our findings is the potential for developing a product for investors, as it can predict the price of cryptocurrencies more accurately. The proposed models were evaluated by collecting historical bitcoin prices from 1 January 2021 to 16 June 2022. The results analysis of the GRU and MLP models revealed that the MLP model achieved highly efficient regression, at R = 99.15% during the training phase and R = 98.90% during the testing phase. These findings have the potential to significantly influence the appropriateness of asset pricing, considering the uncertainties caused by digital currencies. In addition, these findings provide instruments that contribute to establishing stability in cryptocurrency markets. By assisting asset assessments of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, our models deliver high and steady success outcomes over a future prediction horizon. In general, the models described in this article offer approximately accurate estimations of the real value of the bitcoin market. Because the models enable users to assess the timing of bitcoin sales and purchases more accurately, they have the potential to influence the economy significantly when put to use by investors and traders. © 2022 by the authors."

This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm — proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning.

Our C2P2 algorithm is the first algorithm to consider the fact that the price of a cryptocurrency c might depend not only on historical prices, sentiments, global stock indices, but also on the prices and predicted prices of other cryptocurrencies. C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time - rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16%. In both cases, C2P2 is the winner on all cryptocurrencies considered. Moreover, we experimentally show that the use of similarity metrics within our C2P2 algorithm leads to a direct improvement for 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies ranging from 0.4% to 17.8%. Without the similarity component, C2P2 still beats competitors on 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies considered.

New bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that the demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Actually, the price is highly volatile, because it is affected by many factors including the supply of bitcoin, its market demand, the cost of the mining process, as well as economic and political world-class news. In this work, we illustrate a novel approach for bitcoin trend prediction, based on the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). First, we propose a methodology for building useful datasets that take into account social media data, the full blockchain transaction history, and a number of financial indicators. Moreover, we present a cloud-based system characterized by a highly efficient distributed architecture, which allowed us to collect a huge amount of data in order to build thousands of different datasets, using the aforementioned methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses 1D CNN for bitcoin trend prediction. Remarkably, an efficient and low-cost implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNN models that perform one-dimensional convolutions (i.e., scalar multiplications and additions). We show that the 1D CNN model we implemented, trained, validated and tested using the aforementioned datasets, allow one to predict the bitcoin trend with higher accuracy compared to LSTM models. Last but not least, we introduce and simulate a trading strategy based on the proposed 1D CNN model, which increases the profit when the bitcoin trend is bullish and reduces the loss when the trend is bearish. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

Volatility measures the variation of a time series data, and thus it is also a driving factor for the risk forecasting of returns from investment in cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is a decentralized medium of exchange that relies on cryptographic primitives to facilitate the trustless transfer of value between different parties. Instead of being physical money, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries on an online ledger called blockchain that describe specific transactions.Many commonly used risk forecasting models do not take into account the uncertainty associated with the volatility of an underlying asset to obtain the risk forecasts. Some tools from the fuzzy set theory can be incorporated into the forecasting models to account for this uncertainty. Interest in the use of hybrid models for fuzzy volatility forecasts is growing. However, a major drawback is that the fuzzy coefficient hybrid models used in fuzzy volatility forecasts are not data-driven. This paper uses fuzzy set theory with data-driven volatility and data-driven neuro-volatility forecasts to study the fuzzy risk forecasts. The study focuses on long-term volatility forecasts with daily price data while briefly exploring forecasting models with high-frequency (hourly) data as an avenue for future research. Simple yet effective models incorporating fuzziness to obtain fuzzy risk volatility forecasts and fuzzy VaR forecasts are presented. The key underlying idea, unlike the existing risk forecasting, is the use of a hybrid nonlinear adaptive fuzzy model for volatility."

The use of Bitcoin has vastly grown as a financial asset rather than just a tool for online payments. A lot of cryptocurrencies have been created since 2011 with Bitcoin dominating the cryptocurrencies' market. With plenty of cryptocurrencies being used as financial assets and with millions of trades being executed through different exchange services, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to trading problems and challenges similar to those traditionally encountered in the financial domain. Price and trend prediction, volatility prediction, portfolio construction and fraud detection are some examples related to trading. In addition, there are other challenges that are specific to the domain of cryptocurrencies such as mining, cybersecurity, anonymity and privacy. In this paper, we survey the application of artificial intelligence techniques to address these challenges for cryptocurrencies with their vast amount of daily transactions, trades and news that are beyond human capabilities to analyze and learn from.

While price fluctuations seem to cause sentiment for Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP and Doge, predictability was found for Ethereum and Polkadot, based on a bullishness ratio. Finally, predictability of price returns is examined with Vector Autoregression (VAR) and highly accurate forecasts for two of the seven cryptocurrencies were achieved. More specifically, price forecasts of Ethereum's and Polkadot's prices reached 99.67% and 99.17% accuracy, respectively. © 2022 IEEE."

In algorithmic trading, an innovative approach to integrate machine learning can provide data-driven solutions to help people invest with minimal risk and maximum return. This study explores various machine learning techniques to model the nonlinear relationship between bitcoin price and social sentiment data and predict price values with some lead time. Also, the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and lack strict governing bodies and regulators across regions making it more complex and challenging to predict the prices. Through the analysis, it is found that the sentiment data model is superior in capturing the nonlinear relationship compared to the conventional methods of technical indicators and decision trees, while the neural network models are robust and offer better accuracy in predicting the bitcoin price. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Moreover, to verify whether the importance of jumps for RV forecasting changes over time, we extend the standard MIDAS model to characterize two volatility regimes and introduce a jump-driven time-varying transition probability between the two regimes. Our results suggest that the proposed novel MRS-MIDAS model exhibits statistically significant improvement for forecasting the RV of Bitcoin. In addition, we find that jump occurrences significantly increase the persistence of the high-volatility regime and switch between high- and low-volatility regimes.

Fuzzy set theory has a unique ability to quantitatively and qualitatively model and analyze such problems. Volatility forecasting plays an important role in financial risk management and in option pricing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in data-driven volatility models and neurovolatility models for risk forecasting of stocks and index funds. However, even these state-of-the-art models do not take into account the fuzzy volatility in their risk forecasts.Cryptocurrencies are a novel financial asset class based on the Blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity among retail investors as a financial asset with high risks and high returns. The extremely volatile nature of cryptocurrencies (compared to traditional assets) makes forecasting their volatility more challenging. A simple algorithmic trading approach, Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy, is used to calculate the Algo returns. This paper provides fuzzy forecasts of the volatility of Algo returns using the data-driven Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (DD-EWMA) and neuro models for six major cryptocurrencies. We also compute and compare fuzzy volatility forecasts of four major tech stocks and Chicago Board Options Exchangeâs (CBOE) volatility index (VIX) using DD-EWMA and neuro models. Our experimental results show that the data-driven models produce better forecasts for cryptocurrencies as compared to the neuro models, while for the regular stocks and indexes, no such definitive conclusion could be drawn."

Due to attractiveness of Bitcoin in terms of returns and risk, Bitcoin price prediction is attracting a growing attention from both investors and researchers. Indeed, with the development of machine learning and especially deep learning, forecasting Bitcoin is receiving a particular interest. Methods We implement and apply deep forward neural network (DFFNN) for the analysis and forecasting Bitcoin high-frequency price data. Importantly, we seek to investigate the effect of standard numerical training algorithms on the accuracy obtained by DFFNN; namely, the conjugate gradient with Powell-Beale restarts, the resilient algorithm, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The DFFNN was applied to a big dataset composed of 65,535 samples. Results In terms of root mean of squared errors (RMSEs), the simulation results show that the DFFNN trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm outperforms DFFNN trained with Powell-Beale restarts algorithm and DFFNN trained with resilient algorithm. In addition, the resilient algorithm is fast which suggests that it could be promising in online training and trading. Conclusions The DFFNN trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is effective and easy to implement for Bitcoin high-frequency price data forecasting."

Cryptocurrency price prediction is a challenging problem with non-stationary market price and volatility clustering. Cryp-tocurrency data tends to be non-stationary, which means that predictive information extracted using deep learning techniques on observed data can not be used with future data. Moreover, there is a very little signal in cryptocurrency data to indicate the future direction of the market. This paper proposes a sensible way to frame the prediction problem as a dynamic regression problem by defining the features in the feedforward neural networks and the target as an appropriate average of the historical data. The novelty of this paper is to use deep learning algorithms and statistical bootstrapping to obtain cryptocurrency price prediction and the corresponding prediction intervals. It is shown that neural networks are capable of modelling nonlinearity directly for nonlinear time series models. The proposed hybrid approach is evaluated using simulated and cryptocurrency data through numerical experiments.

It gives an edge over the traditional centralized methods as it provides decentralization, immutability, integrity, and anonymity. The most popular application of this technology is cryptocurrencies, which showed a massive rise in their popularity and market capitalization in recent years. Individual investors, big institutions, and corporate firms are investing heavily in it. However, the crypto market is less stable than traditional commodity markets. It can be affected by many technical, sentimental, and legal factors, so it is highly volatile, uncertain, and unpredictable. Plenty of research has been done on various cryptocurrencies to forecast accurate prices, but the majority of these approaches cannot be applied in real-time. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, in this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based hybrid model (includes Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) to predict the price of Litecoin and Zcash with inter-dependency of the parent coin. The proposed model can be used in real-time scenarios and it is well trained and evaluated using standard data sets.

Sliding window is used to obtain point cloud datasets from a multidimensional time series (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple). We apply persistent homology to quantify transient loops that appear in multiscale topological spaces, which associated on each point cloud dataset and encode the quantified information in a persistence landscape. Temporal changes in persistence landscapes are measured via their L1-norms. Consequently, a new representative is attained, called L1-norms time series. The L1-norms is associated with indicators: autocorrelation function at lag 1, variance and mean power spectrum at low frequencies to detect the signals. By using Kendall's tau correlation and significance test, significant rising trend events that occur before major financial crashes in Bitcoin are defined as the signals. A threshold is determined to scan entire data and record all the significant rising trend events. Lastly, we compare L1-norms with residuals time series, which is another representative obtained from de-trending approach. Our result portrays that autocorrelation function at lag 1 and variance of the L1-norms successfully detect early warning signals before the 2017 and 2019 major financial crashes. However, variance of the L1-norms is better since it able to signal another 2018 major financial crash. For the residuals, no early warning signals are detected. Hence, persistent homology provides a better representative than de-trending approach. Overall, persistent homology is a promising method to detect early warning signals of major financial crashes in Bitcoin."

This objective requires to specify whether investors can extend their exposure in certain asset classes and benefit their portfolios in a statistically significant way. In this paper, we address this issue of diversification in the context of cryptoasset portfolios and examine whether their risk-adjusted performance can be enhanced through seeking exposure into the commodities class. For an equally-weighted portfolio of five cryptoassets, we first consider the addition of physical gold, as conceptualised by the CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index, a diversified, monthly-rebalanced index that seeks exposure to both asset classes. We further consider modifying the index composition by replacing physical gold with a basket of five commodities. Mean-variance spanning tests reveal that the addition of physical gold in the original cryptoasset portfolio translates to a significant shift in the efficient frontier, both in terms of the global minimum variance and the tangency portfolios. Additionally, expanding the exposure in the commodity side confirms a statistically significant improvement, with the diversification benefit arising from a shift in the tangency portfolio. We further generate a number of price paths for the original index, the modified index and their components, according to a Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH specification, to assess the efficiency of the index weighted risk contribution scheme. Results demonstrate a superior performance of the two indices when compared against their constituents in terms of Omega ratio. The modified index appears more appropriate for investors that seek higher annual returns, while the original composition would be more appropriate for individuals with moderate annual return goals. © 2021 IEEE."

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation. Further, to check the usability of DL-GuesS on other cryptocurrencies, we have also inferred results for price prediction of Bitcoin-Cash with the price history and tweets of Bitcoin-Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin. © 2013 IEEE."

Specifically, we use two econometric models to perform a two-layer analysis to study the correlation and prediction of Bitcoin and Ether price series with traditional assets. In the first part of this study, we model the probability of positive returns via a Bayesian logistic model. Even though the fitting performance of the logistic model is poor, we find that traditional assets can explain some of the variability of the price returns. Along with the fact that standard models fail to capture the statistic and econometric attributes-such as extreme variability and heteroskedasticity-of cryptocurrencies, this motivates us to apply a novel Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov model to these series. In particular, we model Bitcoin and Ether prices via the non-homogeneous Polya-Gamma Hidden Markov (NHPG) model, since it has been shown that it outperforms its counterparts in conventional financial data. The transition probabilities of the underlying hidden process are modeled via a logistic link whereas the observed series follow a mixture of normal regressions conditionally on the hidden process. Our results show that the NHPG algorithm has good in-sample performance and captures the heteroskedasticity of both series. It identifies frequent changes between the two states of the underlying Markov process. In what constitutes the most important implication of our study, we show that there exist linear correlations between the covariates and the ETH and BTC series. However, only the ETH series are affected non-linearly by a subset of the accounted covariates. Finally, we conclude that the large number of significant predictors along with the weak degree of predictability performance of the algorithm back up earlier findings that cryptocurrencies are unlike any other financial assets and predicting the cryptocurrency price series is still a challenging task. These findings can be useful to investors, policy makers, traders for portfolio allocation, risk management and trading strategies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

However, since financial datasets have very low signal-to-noise ratio and are non-stationary, complex models are often very prone to overfitting and suffer from instability issues. Moreover, as various machine learning and data mining tools become more widely used in quantitative trading, many trading firms have been producing an increasing number of features (aka factors). Therefore, how to automatically select effective features becomes an imminent problem. To address these issues, we propose DoubleEnsemble, an ensemble framework leveraging learning trajectory based sample reweighting and shuffling based feature selection. Specifically, we identify the key samples based on the training dynamics on each sample and elicit key features based on the ablation impact of each feature via shuffling. Our model is applicable to a wide range of base models, capable of extracting complex patterns, while mitigating the overfitting and instability issues for financial market prediction. We conduct extensive experiments, including price prediction for cryptocurrencies and stock trading, using both DNN and gradient boosting decision tree as base models.

By performing sentiment analysis on relevant tweets during the time he was hosting SNL, evidence is found that negative perceptions of Musk’s performance led to a decline in the price of Dogecoin, which dropped 23.4% during the time Musk was on air. This shows that cryptocurrencies are affected in real time by the behaviors of crypto-tastemakers. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

The results across different time scales are tested for noise using permutation entropy technique, empirical estimations are represented in statistical complexity plane to show the structure of efficiency links. Usage of AMIM in short window estimation is justified. Efficiency levels seem to be closely connected if judged from the standpoint of information theory at all time frames. Efficiency linkages become more linear at larger analysis periods. Cryptocurrencies seem to be more closely connected to equities, especially S&P500. Bursts of inefficiency on cryptocurrencies markets spread to equity markets and are possibly mediated in bank system. Commodities seem to be more independently priced. © 2021 The Authors.

Such markets have been developed rapidly and their volatility poses significant research challenges and justifies intensive behavior analysis. For this, we develop statistical and machine learning techniques and apply them to analyze their price variations and to generate inferences. In particular, we utilize deep learning algorithms to predict the closing price of the Ethereum cryptocurrency in a short period. The price data is accumulated from Poloniex exchange and analyzed through a Convolutional Neural Network and four types of Recurrent Neural Network including the Long Short Term Memory network, the Stacked Long Short Term Memory network, the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network, and the Gated Recurrent Unit network. These deep learning models are benchmarked and compared under various metrics.

Although traditionally trading was done by professionals, nowadays a majority of market participants are market-data processing bots due to their inherent advantages in processing large amounts of data, lack of emotions of fear or greed, and predicting market prices through artificial intelligence. A large number of approaches have been brought forward to tackle this task, many of which rely on specially engineered deep learning methods with a focus on specific market conditions. The general limitation of these approaches, however, is the reliance on customized gradient-based methods which limit the scope of possible solutions and don't necessarily generalize well when solving similar problems. This paper proposes a method which uses neuroevolutionary techniques capable of automatically customizing offspring neural networks, generating entire populations of solutions and more thoroughly exploring and parallelizing potential solutions. Our approach uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve increasingly improved populations of neural networks which, based on sentimental and technical analysis data, efficiently predict future market price movements. The effectiveness of this approach is validated by testing the system on both live and historical trading scenarios, and its robustness is tested on other cryptocurrency and stock markets. Experimental results during a 30-day live-trading period show that this method outperformed the buy and hold strategy by over 260%, even while factoring in standard trading fees. © 2021 ACM."

In this paper, we give an exploratory analysis of a network of 24 Reddit communities related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies to analyze Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements. We engineer a set of 112 time series features from submissions and comments made on the selected subreddits, run Granger causality tests on engineered time series against cryptocurrency price movements, and use these time series to forecast the cryptocurrency price movements using classification models.

Cryptocurrencies price behaviour is still largely unexplored, presenting new opportunities for researchers and economists to highlight similarities and differences with standard financial prices. We compared our results with various benchmarks: one recent work on Bitcoin prices forecasting that follows different approaches, a well-known paper that uses Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily NASDAQ closing prices spanning a 3-year interval and another, more recent paper which gives quantitative results on stock market index predictions. We followed different approaches in parallel, implementing both statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms: the Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model for uni-variate series forecast using only closing prices, and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for multivariate series using both price and volume data. We used two artificial neural networks as well: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). While the entire time series resulted to be indistinguishable from a random walk, the partitioning of datasets into shorter sequences, representing different price ""regimes"", allows to obtain precise forecast as evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) and relative Root Mean Square Error (relativeRMSE). In this case the best results are obtained using more than one previous price, thus confirming the existence of time regimes different from random walks.

We term the instances of extreme Bitcoin movement as ‘spikes’. In this paper, spikes are defined as the returns instances that outreach a two-standard deviations band around the mean value. Instead of the unconditional historic standard deviation that is usually used, in this paper, we utilized a GARCH(p,q) model to derive the conditional standard deviation. We claim that the conditional standard deviation is a more suitable measure of on-the-spot risk than the overall standard deviation.

The proposed framework considers tweets that mention the cryptocurrency Dogecoin and analyses the textual content of each of these tweets using a modified version of the lexicon-based sentiment polarity analysis method, VADER. The generated, Twitter sentiment time series is then compared to a time series of the closing prices of Dogecoin for each day. Granger causality analysis showed a unidirectional relationship between Twitter sentiment and cryptocurrency prices for day lags ranging from 2 to 4 days (with a 3-day lag having the lowest statistical significance value). This was also accompanied by a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.6940 and a clear visual correlation between the two time series (with this 3-day lag).

A common limitation of recent fuzzy time series models is their inability to handle non-stationary data. Thus, in this paper we introduce a Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series (NSFTS). In the proposed method, we employ Non-Stationary Fuzzy Sets, in which perturbation functions are used to adapt the membership function parameters in the knowledge base in response to statistical changes in the time series. The flexibility of the method by means of computational experiments was tested with eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several kinds of concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ SP500 and TAIEX), three real FOREX pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, GBP-USD), and two real cryptocoins exchange rates (Bitcoin-USD and Ethereum-USD). As competitor models the Time Variant fuzzy time series and the Incremental Ensemble were used, these are two of the major approaches for handling non-stationary data sets. The proposed method shows resilience to concept drift, by adapting parameters of the model, while preserving the symbolic structure of the knowledge base. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Given the highly connected structure, graph-based modeling is an optimal tool to analyze the data stored in Ethereum blockchain. Recently, several research works performed graph analysis on the publicly available Ethereum blockchain data to reveal insights into its transactions and for important downstream tasks, e.g., cryptocurrency price prediction, address clustering, phishing scams and counterfeit tokens detection. In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey of the existing literature. We categorize them based on publication years, venues, core ranking, and authors' affiliations, data usage and graphs construction, graph mining and machine learning techniques employed, and the new insights derived by them.

hedging with automatic liquidation and leverage selection on bitcoin futures,"alexander c., deng j., zou b.",european journal of operational research,2023,10.1016/j.ejor.2022.07.037,cryptocurrency; finance; leverage; liquidation; perpetual swap,0,Journal,Q1,"Bitcoin derivatives positions are maintained with a self-selected margin, which is often too low to avoid automatic liquidation by the exchange, without notice, especially during periods of excessive volatility. Indeed, according to CryptoQuant, almost $80 billion of positions on centralised exchanges were liquidated during 2021, that is an average of over $200 million per day. So hedgers of bitcoin price risk should account for the possibility of automatic liquidation when taking positions on bitcoin futures. We derive a semi-closed form for an optimal hedging strategy with dual objectives – to minimize both the variance of the hedged portfolio and the probability of liquidation due to insufficient collateral. The solution depends on the statistical characteristics of the spot and futures extreme returns, and other parameters that characterize the hedger by choice of leverage, loss aversion and collateral management. An empirical analysis based on minute-level data compares the performance of the major direct and inverse bitcoin hedging instruments traded on five major exchanges. © 2022 The Author(s)"

Because of its digital nature, Bitcoin cannot be valuated exclusively with fundamental approaches, which is why factors such as investor sentiment have become a common alternative to capture its performance. In this work, we studied whether and how the sale of Bitcoins from the insolvency assets of Mt.Gox, which represent about 1.1% of the current global total, relates to Bitcoin price movements. We used social media sentiment analysis of Twitter data to examine how investors are influenced in their decision to buy or sell Bitcoin when confronted with the trade actions of Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee in charge of the Mt.Gox case. We built a vector error correction model to analyse the long-run relationship between cointegrated variables. Our analysis confirms the positive association of Bitcoin performance with positive Twitter sentiment and tweet volume and the negative association with negative sentiment. We further found empirical evidence that Mt.Gox selloff events have a lasting negative impact on the Bitcoin price and that we can measure this effect by Twitter sentiment and tweet volume. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

hyvadrf: hybrid vader-random forest and gwo for bitcoin tweet sentiment analysis,"mardjo a., choksuchat c.",ieee access,2022,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3209662,bitcoin; gray wolf optimization; hyperparameter; random forest; tweet sentiment analysis; vader,0,Journal,Q1,"In recent years, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been increasingly considered investment options for emerging markets. However, Bitcoin's erratic behavior has discouraged some potential investors. To get insights into its behavior and price fluctuation, past studies have discovered the correlation between Twitter sentiments and Bitcoin behavior. Most of them have exclusively focused on their relationships, instead of the Twitter sentiment analysis itself. Finding the most suitable classification algorithms for sentiment analysis for this kind of data is challenging. For the enormous data in Twitter, the supervised sentiment analysis approach of unlabeled data can be time-consuming and expensive, which has been studied to be superior to unsupervised ones. As such, we propose the HyVADRF (hybrid valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner (VADER)-random forest) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) model. A semantic and rule-based VADER was used to calculate polarity scores and classify sentiments, which overcame the weakness of manual labeling, while a random forest was utilized as its supervised classifier. Furthermore, considering Twitter's massive size, we collected over 3.6 million tweets and analyzed various dataset sizes as these are related to the model's learning process. Lastly, GWO parameter tuning was conducted to optimize the classifier's performance. The results show that 1) the HyVADRF model had an accuracy of 75.29%, precision of 70.22%, recall of 87.70%, and F1-score of 78%. 2) The most ideal dataset size percentage is 90% of the total collected tweets ( n =1 ,249,060). 3) The standard deviations are 0.0008 for accuracy and F1-score and 0.0011 for precision and recall. Hence, the HyVADRF model consistently delivers stable results. © 2013 IEEE."

The market microstructure for bitcoins is highly developed in terms of information generation and transfer. Therefore, returns volatility is highly likely to be affected by market information availability. We analyze the relationship between returns volatility and two independent variables, user opinion difference and user interest. This study adopted the GJR-GARCH model, appropriate for volatility studies. First, we find that, for volatility asymmetry, the Bitcoin market exhibits greater market efficiency than the general financial market. Also, the persistence of volatility is greater. The Bitcoin market is still relatively unregulated; hence, studying the relationship between information asymmetry and regulation in the market is salient. Moreover, we can infer that the ratio of reasonable users is high in the Bitcoin market. Second, the Bitcoin market supports the sequential information arrival hypothesis in that day trading volume, which is a proxy for user differences of opinion, has a statistically significant effect on returns volatility. Third, for the proxies of user interest, namely, the growth rate of page views on Google Trends and Wikipedia, only the growth rate of Google Trends shows statistically significant effects on Bitcoin returns volatility. This study can provide useful information to the financial market and policy makers on the behavior of the Bitcoin market, which may help to lower future entry barriers and opportunity costs of the Bitcoin market. © 2018"

Then, the CPMA model is established to establish a risk assessment mechanism and make preconditions for the decision-making model. Finally, a reinforcement learning model is established based on artificial intelligence, and LSTM is used to extract data features and is combined with DQN algorithm to solve. Based on the CPMA model of problem one, we correlate this improved model with transaction costs. And conduct descriptive statistics on the relationship between yield rate and cost of revenue. It can be seen that the transaction cost adjustment has a large short-term impact on the market, and the long-term impact is relatively small.

In these stock market investments, investors use fundamental analysis tools and indicators very widely. In this way, it is possible to have some knowledge of the situations experienced in the markets and to make a profit. In this study, manipulations on Bitcoin are discussed. Popular machine and statistical forecasting methods have been used to detect these manipulations and the road maps to be followed in order to be detected in the most successful way have been shared. Social media sentiments, which were thought to have an effect on manipulations during the studies, were also evaluated with the most advanced text analysis methods and evaluated together with these price changes. The allegations that the prediction methods carried out before the crisis were more successful were investigated. The Covid-19 pandemic was evaluated as a period of global crisis and the studies that might be relevant were examined. It would not be wrong to say that the actors that make big gains in the stock markets are the ones that determine the direction of the stock market. The manipulation periods of the market actors to be successful in the virtual money markets have been tried to be verified by various estimation methods. These estimations can achieve up to F1 score of 93% success according to our experimental result. Besides, it is stated that accounts with the highest volume of transactions in the periods, when anomalies were detected, were labeled as potential manipulators. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

To this end, we first crawl the tweets related to cryptocurrencies on Twitter, analyze tweets' sentiment, and construct sentiment indicators. Second, we use the historical trading data, daily Google Trends, and sentiment indicators to forecast the movement of cryptocurrency prices using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Third, we propose a portfolio optimization model by considering both the forecasting information and the global minimum variance model, and then derive the corresponding portfolio strategy. Finally, we compare the out-of-sample performance of the proposed strategy with classic portfolio strategies and the Cryptocurrency Index. The empirical results show that: on the one hand, the proposed multi-source data can effectively help forecast the cryptocurrency price movements; on the other hand, the proposed portfolio strategy outperforms traditional portfolio strategies regarding the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and certainty equivalent return, this proves that the proposed strategy can sufficiently combine information between history and future.

Forecasting the Bitcoin price as accurate as possible is essential, but due to its high volatility this task is challenging. Many researchers try, through the years, to develop efficient models for predicting the Bitcoin price using several different data-driven approaches. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel decomposition-ensemble learning model that combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) with machine learning algorithms to forecast the Bitcoin price multi-step ahead. The algorithms are k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel, Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with single-layer perceptron, Generalized Linear Model, and Cubist. Correlation matrix (CORR), principal component analysis (PCA), and Box-Cox transformation (BOXCOX) were used as data preprocessing techniques. Estimating the performance of the proposed models (namely VMD-STACK-CORR, VMD-STACK-PCA, and VMD-STACK-BOXCOX) using relative root mean square error, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and absolute percentage error measures, defined that for one-day-ahead forecast VMD-STAK-BOXCOX model presented the better performance, and for two and three-days-ahead forecast VMD-STACK-CORR model was chosen, compared to VMD, STACK, and machine learning algorithms models' performance. Diebold-Mariano statistical test was conducted to evaluate a reduction in forecasting errors.

Indeed, there has been a plethora of DL-based trading methods proposed in recent years. Despite the success of these methods, they typically rely on a very restricted set of information, usually employing only price-related information. As a result, they ignore sentiment-related information, which can have a profound impact and be a strong predictor of various assets, such as cryptocurencies. The contribution of this paper is multifold. First, we examine whether the use of sentiment information, as extracted by various online sources, including news articles, is beneficial when training DL agents for trading. Then, given the difficulty of training reliable sentiment extractors for financial applications, we evaluate the impact of using different DL models as sentiment extractors, as well as employ an unsupervised training pipeline for further improving their performance. Finally, we propose an effective multisource sentiment fusion approach that can improve the performance over the rest of the evaluated approaches. The conducted experiments have been performed using several different configurations and models, ranging from multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to provide a reliable evaluation of sentiment-aware DL-based trading strategies providing evidence that sentiment information might be a stronger predictor compared to the information provided by the actual price time series for Bitcoin. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

However, due to their uncertainty, volatility, and dynamism, forecasting crypto prices is a challenging time series analysis task. Researchers have proposed predictors based on statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches, but the literature is limited. Indeed, it is narrow because it focuses on predicting only the prices of the few most famous cryptos. In addition, it is scattered because it compares different models on different cryptos inconsistently, and it lacks generality because solutions are overly complex and hard to reproduce in practice. The main goal of this paper is to provide a comparison framework that overcomes these limitations. We use this framework to run extensive experiments where we compare the performances of widely used statistical, ML, and DL approaches in the literature for predicting the price of five popular cryptocurrencies, i.e., XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Monero (XMR). To the best of our knowledge, we are also the first to propose using the temporal fusion transformer (TFT) on this task. Moreover, we extend our investigation to hybrid models and ensembles to assess whether combining single models boosts prediction accuracy. Our evaluation shows that DL approaches are the best predictors, particularly the LSTM, and this is consistently true across all the cryptos examined. LSTM reaches an average RMSE of (Formula presented.) and MAE of (Formula presented.), respectively, (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) better than the second-best model.

For this purpose, a wide variety of GARCH-type models have been employed. However, there is no consensus in the literature on which specification arising from the volatility equation and the assumed error distribution is better in an out-of-sample performance. This study tries to fill this gap by comparing the forecasting performances of 110 GARCH-type models for Bitcoin volatility. Furthermore, it proposes a new combining method based on support vector machines (SVM). This method effectively selects the set of superior models to perform meta-learning. The results indicate that the best performing GARCH specification depends on the loss function chosen, and the proposed method leads to more accurate volatility forecasts than those of the best GARCH-type models and other combining methods investigated.

The proposed model consists of using parent coins as a parameter for price prediction to overcome market volatility. Moving average is used as a data preprocessing technique for the effective prediction of Litecoin and Dogecoin prices.

The increased use of machine learning techniques to predict time series and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments motivated the present study to seek more accurate predictions for the Bitcoin exchange rate. In this way, in a first stage of the proposed methodology, different feature selection techniques were evaluated in order to obtain the most relevant attributes for the predictions. In the sequence, it was analyzed the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble algorithms (based on Recurrent Neural Networks and the k-Means clustering method) for price direction predictions. Likewise, the ANN and SVM were employed for regression of the maximum, minimum and closing prices of the Bitcoin.

Despite these efforts, the literature has no model for predicting the prices of seasonal goods (e.g., Christmas gifts). In this context, we framed the task of seasonal goods price prediction as a regression problem. First, we utilized a real online trailer dataset of Christmas gifts and then we proposed several machine learning-based models and one statistical-based model to predict the prices of these seasonal products. Second, we utilized a real-life dataset of Christmas gifts for the prediction task. Then, we proposed support vector regressor (SVR), linear regression, random forest, and ridge models as machine learning models for price prediction. Next, we proposed an autoregressive-integrated-moving-average (ARIMA) model for the same purpose as a statistical-based model.

People have been using learning tools from diverse fields such as financial mathematics and machine learning to make trustworthy forecasting on such markets. However, the accuracy of such techniques had not been adequate until artificial neural network frameworks such as long short-term memory (LSTM) were utilized. Moreover, making accurate real-time forecasting, also known as nowcasting, of financial time series is highly subjective to the LSTM's architecture in use and the procedure of training it. Herein, we forecast financial markets in real-time by training a dual version of LSTM which forecasts only one time step at each iteration so that the forecast for this iteration will be in the input for the next iteration. Semi-convergence is a prominent issue in a recurrent LSTM setup as the error could propagate through iterations; however, the duality of this LSTM aids in dwindling this issue. Especially, we employ one LSTM to find the best number of epochs associated with the least loss and train the second LSTM only through that many epochs to make forecasting. We treat the current forecast as a part of the training set for the next forecast and train the same LSTM. While classic ways of training cause more error when the forecast is made further away through the test period, our approach offers superior accuracy as the training increases when it proceeds through the testing period. The forecasting accuracy of our approach is validated using three time series from each of the three diverse financial markets: stock, cryptocurrency, and commodity. The results are compared with those of a single LSTM, an extended Kalman filter, and an autoregressive integrated moving average model. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

There are many algorithms for price prediction for crypto currencies like LSTM and ARIMA. However, the downside is that LSTM-based RNNs are difficult to comprehend, and gaining intuition into their behavior is tough. In order to produce decent outcomes, rigorous hyperparameter adjustment is also essential. Furthermore, crypto currencies do not precisely adhere to past data, and patterns change fast, reducing the accuracy of predictions. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Because the data is dynamic and heavily influenced by various seasons, the ARIMA model is unable to handle seasonal data. In order to provide better price predictions for crypto traders, a new model is required. The objective of the study is to apply Fbprophet model as the key model because it is superior in functionality as compared to LSTM and ARIMA additionally removing the pitfalls generated in LSTM and ARIMA model while analyzing the cryptocurrency data. This study provides a methodology for predicting the future price of bitcoin that does not rely solely on past data due to seasonality in historical data. So, after fitting the seasonality and smoothing, the model is constructed that can be useful for real-world use cases. In case of crypto currencies where less historical data is available and it is hard to find pattern, proposed method can easily deal this type of problems. Overall difference between predicted and actual values is low as compared to other model even after seasonal data was available. © 2022"

Thus at present, many researchers are focus on analyzing and forecasting. The existing studies on Bitcoin price prediction are mainly in two ways: (1) study how economic factors, market and investor sentiment indicators influence Bitcoin price; (2) apply machine learning and artificial neural networks to predict the value of Bitcoin. This paper aims to implement a scenario analysis method to generate various hypothetical events and then determine their effects on the value of Bitcoin price. Scenario analysis is normally used to measure financial risk. In this paper, we propose a method that combines scenario analysis with historical data. We further aim to find the correlations among scenarios and examine the relationship between the significant shocks and Bitcoin prices. Our findings suggest that what-if analysis is a good way to measure the risk exposure of Bitcoin. The method can also be used for worse-scenario analysis to check how Bitcoin performs during crisis periods. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."
sentiment analysis and emotion detection on cryptocurrency related tweets using ensemble lstm-gru model,"aslam n., rustam f., lee e., washington p.b., ashraf i.",ieee access,2022,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3165621,cryptocurrency; emotion analysis; machine learning; sentiment analysis; text2emotion,2,Journal,Q1,"The cryptocurrency market has been developed at an unprecedented speed over the past few years. Cryptocurrency works similar to standard currency, however, virtual payments are made for goods and services without the intervention of any central authority. Although cryptocurrency ensures legitimate and unique transactions by utilizing cryptographic methods, this industry is still in its inception and serious concerns have been raised about its use. Analysis of the sentiments about cryptocurrency is highly desirable to provide a holistic view of peoples' perceptions. In this regard, this study performs both sentiment analysis and emotion detection using the tweets related to the cryptocurrency which are widely used for predicting the market prices of cryptocurrency. For increasing the efficacy of the analysis, a deep learning ensemble model LSTM-GRU is proposed that combines two recurrent neural networks applications including long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). LSTM and GRU are stacked where the GRU is trained on the features extracted by LSTM. Utilizing term frequency-inverse document frequency, word2vec, and bag of words (BoW) features, several machine learning and deep learning approaches and a proposed ensemble model are investigated. Furthermore, TextBlob and Text2Emotion are studied for emotion analysis with the selected models. Comparatively, a larger number of people feel happy with the use of cryptocurrency, followed by fear and surprise emotions. Results suggest that the performance of machine learning models is comparatively better when BoW features are used. The proposed LSTM-GRU ensemble shows an accuracy of 0.99 for sentiment analysis, and 0.92 for emotion prediction and outperforms both machine learning and state-of-the-art models. © 2013 IEEE."

Asset pricing is a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders. Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model, we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario. © 2020 IEEE."

An adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface-based network was used to predict the prices of three selected cryptocurrencies, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin. The difference from the current study is that Twitter sentiment and Google trends have not been used as a predictor in a neuro-fuzzy network before. ANFIS has the advantage of combining the properties of fuzzy systems and neural networks. This advantage is manifested in producing lower error and higher accuracy in predictions. According to the findings, different results were obtained for different cryptocurrencies in the model in which the ANFIS estimation method was used.

The quality of a project affects the trust in the platform, and therefore the value of the digital tokens exchanged over it. In this paper, we investigate whether developers’ emotions can effectively provide insights that can improve the prediction of the price of tokens. We consider developers’ comments and activity for two major blockchain projects, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, extracted from Github. We measure sentiment and emotions (joy, love, anger, etc.) of the developers’ comments over time, and test the corresponding time series (i.e. the affect time series) for correlations and causality with the Bitcoin/Ethereum time series of prices. Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers’ emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price. Moreover, using an artificial recurrent neural network (LSTM), we can show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)—associated with the prediction of the prices of cryptocurrencies—significantly decreases when including the affect time series. © 2020, The Author(s)."

Under the assumption that the cryptocurrency market has unobserved heterogeneity, an HMM allows us to study (1) the extent to which cryptocurrency markets shift due to interactions with social sentiment during a bull or bear market and (2) the heterogeneous pattern of cryptocurrency market behavior under these two market conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors advance the HMM model based on two six-month datasets (from November 2017 to April 2018 for a bull market and from December 2018 to May 2019 for a bear market) collected from Google, Twitter, the stock market and cryptocurrency trading platforms in South Korea. Social sentiment data were collected by crawling Bitcoin-related posts on Twitter. Findings: The authors highlight the reaction of the cryptocurrency market to social sentiment under a bull and a bear market and in two hidden states (an upward and a downward trend). They find: (1) social sentiment is relatively relevant during a bull compared to a bear market. (2) The cryptocurrency market in a downward state, that is, with a local decreasing trend, tends to be more responsive to positive social sentiment. (3) The market in an upward state, that is, with a local increasing trend, tends to better interact with negative social sentiment. Originality/value: The proposed HMM model contributes to a theoretically grounded understanding of how cryptocurrency markets respond to social sentiment in bull and bear markets through varied sequences adjusted for cryptocurrency market heterogeneity. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This study analyzes the Bitcoin cryptocurrency price series and web search queries with regard to their mutual predictability and cause-effect delay structure. Chinese Baidu engine searches and compounded Baidu–Google search statistics predict Bitcoin price dynamics at relatively high frequencies ranging from 2 to 5 months. In the other direction, Granger-causality runs from the cryptocurrency price to queries statistics across nearly all frequencies. In both directions, the reaction time computed from a phase delay measure for the relevant frequency bands with significant causality ranges from about 1 to 4 months. For either direction, out-of-sample forecasts are more accurate than forecasts of a benchmark stochastic process. Bivariate models including the Baidu Search Index slightly outperform competing models that include a Baidu–Google composite index.

The developed models are feasible and have high performance, with the classification models scoring up to 65% accuracy for next-day forecast and scoring from 62 to 64% accuracy for seventh-ninetieth-day forecast. For daily price forecast, the error percentage is as low as 1.44%, while it varies from 2.88 to 4.10% for horizons of seven to ninety days.

what drives cryptocurrency prices? an investigation of google trends and telegram sentiment,smuts n.,performance evaluation review,2019,10.1145/3308897.3308955,bitcoin; cryptocurrency; ethereum; google trends; lstm; sentiment; telegram,20,Conference,Journal - Unranked,"The Google Trends 1 search analysis service and the Telegram 2 messaging platform are investigated to determine their respective relationships to cryptocurrency price behaviour. It is shown that, in contrast to earlier findings, the relationship between cryptocurrency price movements and internet search volumes obtained from Google Trends is no longer consistently positive, with strong negative correlations detected for Bitcoin and Ethereum during June 2018. Sentiment extracted from cryptocurrency investment groups on Telegram is found to be positively correlated to Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements, particularly during periods of elevated volatility. The number of messages posted on a Bitcoin-themed Telegram group is found to be an indicator of Bitcoin price action in the subsequent week. A long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is developed to predict the direction of cryptocurrency prices using data obtained from Google Trends and Telegram. It is shown that Telegram data is a better predictor of the direction of the Bitcoin market than Google Trends. The converse is true for Ethereum. The LSTM model produces the most accurate results when predicting price movements over a one-week period. Copyright is held by author/owner(s)."
