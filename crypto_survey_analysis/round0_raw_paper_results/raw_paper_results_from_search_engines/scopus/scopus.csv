While there is no theoretical guarantee that deep learning (DL)-based solutions perform better than classic machine learning (ML)-based ones, DL-based models have become the common default. This paper compares well-known DL-based and ML-based models and shows that in the case of malicious traffic classification, state-of-the-art DL-based solutions do not necessarily outperform the classical ML-based ones. We exemplify this finding using two well-known datasets for a varied set of tasks, such as: malware detection, malware family classification, detection of zero-day attacks, and classification of an iteratively growing dataset. Note that, it is not feasible to evaluate all possible models to make a concrete statement, thus the above finding is not a recommendation to avoid DL-based models, but rather an empirical finding that in some cases, there are more simplistic solutions, that may perform even better. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Encrypted traffic classification; Machine learning; Malware classification; Malware detection",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85141515864

During the ICO process, whitepapers are important not only as promotional material through which ventures can demonstrate the technical and financial project details but also as references for investors. Persuasion theory and the related literature suggest that the presentation and order of information have a significant impact on the attitude of the audience. Therefore, in addition to projects’ metadata features, we construct a document analysis deep regression model (DADRM) to innovatively extract deep text and layout features from whitepapers. Based on a real-life dataset, we conduct a comparative study to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework in predicting ICO success in terms of the funding amount. The empirical results show that our model that both extracts text content and retains the original 2D structure of the document can significantly reduce prediction error. Based on our proposed model, both ICO platforms and investors can prejudge the funding amount of cryptocurrency projects and mitigate information asymmetry. Additionally, this study demonstrates that both what is written in the business document and how the document is presented affect investor decisions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cryptocurrency; Document Layout Analysis; Initial Coin Offering; Text Mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135883570

The scope of this study is to evaluate cryptocurrencies and forecast their price in the context of the currency rate trends. A public survey was conducted to determine which cryptocurrency is the most well-known among Bangladeshi people. According to the survey respondents, Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency among the eight digital currencies. After that, we'll explore the four most well-known cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Tether token. The 'YFinance' python package collects our cryptocurrency dataset, and the relative strength index (RSI) is employed to investigate these cryptocurrencies. Autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are applied to our time-series data from 2015-1-1 to 2021-6-1. Using the 'closing' price and a simple moving average (SMA) graph, bitcoin and tether are identified as oversold or overbought cryptocurrencies. We employ the seasonal decomposed technique into the dataset before implementing the model, and the augmented dickey-fuller test (ADF) indicates too much seasonality in the dataset. The autoregressive (AR) model is the most accurate in predicting the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Tether-token, with 97.21%, 96.04%, 95.8%, and 99.91% accuracy, consecutively. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

We validated our method on a dataset of 151 consecutive patients with detected PFO at a large grade A hospital in China from November 2018 to December 2020, we obtained an area under the relative operating characteristic curve of 0.816, with 65% specificity at 73% sensitivity.

In addition, it contributes by breaking down barriers found in past experimental studies in this field by using more sophisticated methods. The datasets this empirical research utilized were secondary quantitative data of the real prices of the currently most used cryptocurrencies.

Indeed, there has been a plethora of DL-based trading methods proposed in recent years. Despite the success of these methods, they typically rely on a very restricted set of information, usually employing only price-related information. As a result, they ignore sentiment-related information, which can have a profound impact and be a strong predictor of various assets, such as cryptocurencies. The contribution of this paper is multifold. First, we examine whether the use of sentiment information, as extracted by various online sources, including news articles, is beneficial when training DL agents for trading. Then, given the difficulty of training reliable sentiment extractors for financial applications, we evaluate the impact of using different DL models as sentiment extractors, as well as employ an unsupervised training pipeline for further improving their performance. Finally, we propose an effective multisource sentiment fusion approach that can improve the performance over the rest of the evaluated approaches. The conducted experiments have been performed using several different configurations and models, ranging from multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to provide a reliable evaluation of sentiment-aware DL-based trading strategies providing evidence that sentiment information might be a stronger predictor compared to the information provided by the actual price time series for Bitcoin. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Financial trading; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment-aware trading",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133388571

The crypto market was capitalized at more than USD 3000 bn, having grown from USD 10 m over the period 2011–2021. Generating high returns, investments in cryptocurrencies have also shown high levels of price volatility. By comparing the performance of cryptocurrencies (measured by the crypto index) and standard equities (included in the S&P 500 index), we found that the former has outperformed the latter 14 times over the last two years. In the present paper, we analyzed the 2012–2022 global crypto market developments and main constituents. With a focus on the top 30 cryptocurrencies and their prices, as of 9 April 2022, covering data of the two major market stress events—outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020) and the Russian invasion of Ukraine (February 2022). We applied the dynamic time warping method including barycentre averaging and k-Shape clustering of time series. The use of the dynamic time warping has been essential for the preparation of data for subsequent clustering and forecasting. In addition, we compared performance of cryptocurrencies and equities. Cryptocurrency time series are rather short, sometimes involving high levels of volatility and including multiple data gaps, whereas equity time series are much longer and well-established. Identifying similarities between them allows analysts to predict crypto prices by considering the evolution of similar equity instruments and their responses to historical events and stress periods. Moreover, we tested various forecasting methods on the 30 cryptocurrencies to compare traditional econometric methods with machine learning approaches. © 2022 by the authors.","ARIMA; cluster analysis; cryptocurrency; dynamic time warping; machine learning",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139838721

Simply centralizing these multi-sourced data for training would raise critical security and privacy concerns, and might be prohibited given the increasingly strict data regulations. To resolve the tension between privacy and data utilization in distributed learning, a machine learning framework called private aggregation of teacher ensembles (PATE) has been recently proposed. PATE harnesses the knowledge (label predictions for an unlabeled dataset) from distributed teacher models to train a student model, obviating access to distributed datasets. Despite being enticing, PATE does not offer protection for the individual label predictions from teacher models, which still entails privacy risks. In this paper, we propose SEDML, a new protocol which allows to securely and efficiently harness the distributed knowledge in machine learning. SEDML builds on lightweight cryptography and provides strong protection for the individual label predictions, as well as differential privacy guarantees on the aggregation results. Extensive evaluations show that while providing privacy protection, SEDML preserves the accuracy as in the plaintext baseline. Meanwhile, SEDML outperforms the state-of-the-art work of Xiang et al.

The limited supply, high volatility, and random price fluctuations have increased investors' interest in BTC, especially in daily trading. Although BTC has been yielding a high rate of returns, price fluctuations and constant speculations make the investors wary of unexpected price movements. Predictive modeling suffers from the complexity of the datasets (i.e., the high number of features employed to forecast BTC movements) as well as the black-box nature of most machine learning algorithms (which is especially problematic for corporate investors since they are obligated to disclose their investment decisions to their clients). Therefore, the main goal of the current study is to assist individual and corporate investors in making transparent and interpretable daily BTC trading decisions by developing a predictive analytics framework. To address the complexities posed by the datasets, a comprehensive tri-level feature selection approach is proposed. The selected features are then, fed into the Classification & Regression Tree (C&RT) to build a highly parsimonious, transparent, and interpretable prediction model. The resultant model was not only evaluated on the test (holdout) sample but was also tested on challenging time periods, including the first half of 2020 (the start of the pandemic era) to exhibit the viability and reliability of the proposed framework. Finally, a decision support tool is developed for the practical implementation of the model. The tool can be used by short-term investors not only due to its highly simplistic, transparent, and interpretable structure, but also its higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity results when compared to the extant literature. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bitcoin; C&RT; Cryptocurrency; Decision support systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Price prediction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129770347

Blockchain technology integrates different recognition techniques of distributed pattern for monitoring database of a dedicated network and has proven a very promising technology. An automated pattern recognition decentralizes and distributes customized specific data. Machine learning, originated from artificial intelligence is primarily related to recognition of behavior patterns. Methods like knowledge discovery in database (KDD) and data mining focus on unsupervised approaches and are widely used in business and climatic weather applications. Blockchain addresses data-security concerns and builds trust by creating distributed ledger. Theft, willful fraud, software and hardware are considered by blockchain in data protection. Blockchain has greater significant feature as it makes the secure data access without enabling the central management entity. Two design features of blockchain technology help in this task. Recommended customer data pattern recognition technique using blockchain may eliminate all these problems. Two kinds of cryptographic algorithms employed in blockchain are asymmetric-key algorithms and hash functions. The current study analyzes the asymmetric cryptography approach along with key pair which supports in system security. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier techniques consider both old customers and new customers as stable.

Since its inception, in a short period of time Bitcoin got wide popularity and considered as an investment asset. At present it is the most successful cryptocurrency compared to other altcoins dispersed in the world economy. The Bitcoin prices fluctuate like other stock markets due to inherent volatility. The investors’ confidence on Bitcoin rising fast and have been reflected on its prices. Though few computational intelligence methods are available, sophisticated methodologies for accurate prediction of Bitcoin are still lacking and need to be explored. Functional link neural network (FLN) is a flat network, offers lower computational complexity, and achieves enhanced input–output nonlinearity mapping through functional expansion of input signals. Basis functions such as Legendre, Trigonometric, Laguerre, and Chebyshev are commonly used polynomials in FLN for expansion of input signal dimension. In this article along with the weight and bias vector of FLNs, optimal number of polynomial functions for each category of basis function is selected by genetic algorithm during training process rather fixing them earlier. Therefore, an optimal FLN structure is crafted on fly from exploitation of training data. The optimal FLN models are used to predict the daily, weekly, and monthly closing prices of Bitcoin. A comparative study among optimal FLNs is carried out using evaluation metrics such as MAPE, NMSE, ARV, and U of Theil’s statistics. Finally, outcomes from experimental and comparative studies suggested the superiority of optimal FLN models for Bitcoin closing price prediction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bitcoin; Chebyshev function; Cryptocurrency prediction; Functional link neural network; Genetic algorithm; Legendre polynomial; Trigonometric basis function",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103081478

While this highly volatile market offers great profit opportunities to investors, it also brings risks due to its sensitivity to speculative news and the unpredictable behaviour of major investors that can cause unsual price movements. In this paper, we argue that rapid and high price fluctuations or unusual patterns that occur in this way may negatively affect the functionality of technical signals that constitute a basis for feature extraction in a machine learning (ML)-based trading system and this may cause the generalization of the model to deteriorate. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end ML-based trading system including a time series outlier detection module that detects the periods in which unusual price formations are observed. The training of the classification algorithms for the price direction prediction task was performed on the remaining data. We present the results related to the accuracy of the classification models as well as the simulation results obtained using the proposed system for real time trading on the historical data. The findings showed that the outlier detection step significantly increases return on investment for the machine learning-based trading strategies. Besides, the results showed that during the highly volatile periods the trading system becomes more profitable compared to the baseline model and buy&hold strategy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anomaly detection; Dynamic time warping; Hierarchical clustering; Machine learning; Outlier detection; Price prediction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127357201

The lake cryptodepression, filled with 220 million m3 of fresh drinking water, represents a specific karst phenomenon. To better understand the impact of water level change drivers, the occurrence of meteorological and hydrological droughts was analysed. Basic machine learning methods (ML) such as the multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to simulate water levels. Modelling was carried out considering annual inputs of precipitation, air temperature, and abstraction rate as well as their influential lags which were determined by auto-correlation and cross-correlation techniques. Hydrological droughts have been recorded since 1986, and after 2006 a series of mostly mild hot to moderate hot years was recorded. All three ML models have been trained to recognize extreme conditions in the form of less precipitation, high abstraction rate, and, consequently, low water levels in the testing (predicting) period. The best statistical indicators were achieved with the MNLR model. The methodologies applied in the study were found to be useful tools for the analysis of changes in water levels.

There are many algorithms for price prediction for crypto currencies like LSTM and ARIMA. However, the downside is that LSTM-based RNNs are difficult to comprehend, and gaining intuition into their behavior is tough. In order to produce decent outcomes, rigorous hyperparameter adjustment is also essential. Furthermore, crypto currencies do not precisely adhere to past data, and patterns change fast, reducing the accuracy of predictions. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Because the data is dynamic and heavily influenced by various seasons, the ARIMA model is unable to handle seasonal data. In order to provide better price predictions for crypto traders, a new model is required. The objective of the study is to apply Fbprophet model as the key model because it is superior in functionality as compared to LSTM and ARIMA additionally removing the pitfalls generated in LSTM and ARIMA model while analyzing the cryptocurrency data. This study provides a methodology for predicting the future price of bitcoin that does not rely solely on past data due to seasonality in historical data. So, after fitting the seasonality and smoothing, the model is constructed that can be useful for real-world use cases. In case of crypto currencies where less historical data is available and it is hard to find pattern, proposed method can easily deal this type of problems. Overall difference between predicted and actual values is low as compared to other model even after seasonal data was available. © 2022","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Fbprophet model; Machine learning; Prediction; Time series analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136285087

In order to achieve this, we present an efficient algorithm for multimodal statistical causality analysis based on Multiple-Output Gaussian Processes. Signals from different information sources (modalities) are jointly modelled as a Multiple-Output Gaussian Process, and then using a novel approach to statistical causality based on Gaussian Processes (GPs), we study linear and non-linear causal effects between the different modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a machine learning application by studying the relationship between cryptocurrency spot price dynamics and sentiment time-series data specific to the crypto sector, which we conjecture influences retail investor behaviour. The investor sentiment is extracted from cryptomarket news data via methods developed in the area of statistical machine learning known as Natural Language Processing (NLP). To capture sentiment, we present a novel framework for text to time-series embedding, which we then use to construct a sentiment index from publicly available news articles. We conduct a statistical analysis of our sentiment statistical index model and compare it to alternative state-of-the-art sentiment models popular in the NLP literature. In regard to the multimodal causality, the investor sentiment is our primary modality of exploration, in addition to price and a blockchain technology-related indicator (hash rate). Analysis shows that our approach is effective in modelling causal structures of variable degree of complexity between heterogeneous data sources and illustrates the impact that certain modelling choices for the different modalities can have on detecting causality.

Then, a novel structure of our improvised FTS, denoted as QFTS, is presented in this paper, which aims to rectify all flaws exist in all conventional FTS based models in literature. A further hybrid of QFTS with ANN is also presented. Later, a comparative analysis of all the aforementioned FTS models is presented in terms of overall forecasting accuracy and forecasting accuracy under specific conditions. The results are being compared in terms of MAPE. The newly invented QFTS model and the QFTS-ANN hybrid is found to profoundly outperform all the existing FTS models in literature, which includes Singh's FTS model. Such innovation profoundly rectifies severe shortcomings in financial forecasting that have persisted for many years in the past literature. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Bitcoin price; Forecasting; Fuzzy set; Fuzzy time series; Genetic algorithm; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129063634

Traditional PLA schemes exploiting channel state information (CSI) face significant challenges in mobile communication scenarios due to the unknown variation of wireless channels. To address this challenge, we propose a PLA scheme based on Gaussian process (GP) channel prediction, where the variation of channel characteristics is tracked and predicted. Specifically, historical CSI attributes together with the transmitter's geographical information are exploited to establish a mapping to predict the next legitimate CSI for authentication. Furthermore, to overcome the impracticality of applying conventional PLA framework for authentication, where an unrealistic assumption that either the prior knowledge of the adversary's statistical channel model or even the real observations of its CSI data is required, we propose the so-called one-class authentication (OCA) scheme, which does not require any attacker's channel information. We exploit the quasideterministic radio channel generator (QuaDRiGa) simulation platform as the generator of CSI for experimental verifications. Simulation tests are performed to demonstrate that our method improves authentication performance significantly in time-varying scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.","Gaussian process (GP); Machine learning (ML); One-class classification; Physical layer authentication (PLA); Time varying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115726550

Recently, researchers have aimed to improve the performance of price prediction methods by applying deep learning-based models. However, most studies have focused on predicting cryptocurrency prices for the following day. Therefore, clients are inconvenienced by the necessity of rapidly making complex decisions on actions that support maximizing their profit, such as “Sell”, “Buy”, and “Wait”. Furthermore, very few studies have explored the use of deep learning models to make recommendations for these actions, and the performance of such models remains low. Therefore, to solve these problems, we propose a deep learning model and three input features: sellProfit, buyProfit, and maxProfit. Through these concepts, clients are provided with criteria on which action would be most beneficial at a given current time. These criteria can be used as decision-making indices to facilitate profit maximization. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, daily price data of six representative cryptocurrencies were used to conduct an experiment. The results confirm that the proposed model showed approximately 13% to 21% improvement over existing methods and is statistically significant. © 2022 by the authors.

However, much less work has been performed around the security of edge AI. Machine learning models are a mass of intellectual property, and an optimized network is very valuable. Trained machine learning models need to be black boxes as well because they may give away information about the training data to the outside world. As selecting the appropriate activation functions to enable fast training of accurate deep neural networks is an active area of research, it is important to conceal the information of the activation functions used in a neural network architecture as well. There has been research on the use of physical attacks such as the side-channel attack (SCA) in areas other than cryptography. The SCA is highly effective against edge artificial intelligence due to its property of the device computing close to the user. We studied a previously proposed method to retrieve the activation functions of a black box neural network implemented on an edge device by using simple electromagnetic analysis (SEMA) and improved the signal processing procedure for further noisy measurements. The SEMA attack identifies activation functions by directly observing distinctive electromagnetic (EM) traces that correspond to the operations in the activation function. This method requires few executions and inputs and also has little implementation dependency on the activation functions. We distinguished eight similar activation functions with EM measurements and examined the versatility and limits of this attack.

We propose a two-stage forecasting that comprises discrete wavelet transform as the decomposition method and a deep long short-term memory network as the forecasting algorithm. Beside analyzing forecasting for both univariate and multivariate regression, we design a simulated trading system to put the forecasts into practice and analyze the economic profitability of the predictors. In addition, we shed light on the black box method by implementing sensitivity analysis. To investigate the predictors’ efficacy through time and consider the effects of early 2018 price spike, the dataset is split into two periods: (1) prior to and including the spike and (2) after the spike. According to the experiments, it is hard to choose one predictor over the other in the first period. However, in the second period, Gold and Oil show the highest statistical accuracy, while S&P500 is the most profit-making predictor. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin returns; Cryptocurrency; Deep learning; Discrete wavelet transform; Financial forecasting; LSTM",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127159445

While uptake of this new medium is relatively slow, we feel the prospects of blockchain technology are up-and-coming. NFTs are still largely misunderstood by the wider community, and as such, this provides a fascinating opportunity to explore the NFT marketplace in greater depth.

We examine user behaviour in the market to show that a small subset of heavy-hitters is driving massive growth. Secondly, we review the economic activity within the network to show how these power users drive extreme price volatility within the Art and Collectible categories. Lastly, we review the network of buyers and sellers to show that despite the sparsity that exists in the network, communities of users are forming, and most power users tend to congregate in these structures.

Under the assumption that the cryptocurrency market has unobserved heterogeneity, an HMM allows us to study (1) the extent to which cryptocurrency markets shift due to interactions with social sentiment during a bull or bear market and (2) the heterogeneous pattern of cryptocurrency market behavior under these two market conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors advance the HMM model based on two six-month datasets (from November 2017 to April 2018 for a bull market and from December 2018 to May 2019 for a bear market) collected from Google, Twitter, the stock market and cryptocurrency trading platforms in South Korea. Social sentiment data were collected by crawling Bitcoin-related posts on Twitter. Findings: The authors highlight the reaction of the cryptocurrency market to social sentiment under a bull and a bear market and in two hidden states (an upward and a downward trend). They find: (1) social sentiment is relatively relevant during a bull compared to a bear market. (2) The cryptocurrency market in a downward state, that is, with a local decreasing trend, tends to be more responsive to positive social sentiment. (3) The market in an upward state, that is, with a local increasing trend, tends to better interact with negative social sentiment. Originality/value: The proposed HMM model contributes to a theoretically grounded understanding of how cryptocurrency markets respond to social sentiment in bull and bear markets through varied sequences adjusted for cryptocurrency market heterogeneity. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bear market; Bull market; Cryptocurrency market behavior; Hidden Markov model; Sentiment analysis; Unobserved heterogeneity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119625709

Nowadays, cryptocurrency trade constitutes one of the most popular and promising type of profitable investments. Nevertheless, this new and constantly increasing financial market is characterized by high volatility and strong fluctuations of prices over time. As a result, it is considered essential for portfolio optimization and management, the development of a forecasting model. In this work, we propose a new time-series model based on dropout weight-constrained recurrent neural networks for forecasting cryptocurrency prices and the value of Crypto-Currency index 30 (CCi30). The proposed forecasting model exploits advanced regularization techniques for reducing the fundamental problem of overfitting. More specifically, it is characterized by the imposition of box-constraints on the weights of the network for reducing the likelihood of them blowing up to unrealistic values. Additionally, the adoption of dropout technique aims to explore hard-reaching regions of the weight space and forces the weights to away from zero. The proposed forecasting model was evaluated against state-of-the-art types of neural networks and regression models for forecasting the price of the four most widely traded digital currencies and for the prediction of CCi30 index. Our conducted experimental and detailed statistical analysis demonstrate that although weight-constrained networks give significant improvements the adoption of dropout technique in weight-constrained networks provides a boost in increasing the forecasting performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","CCi30 index; Cryptocurrency; Dropout; Forecasting; Weight-constrained neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098600584

This study ex-periments with three different time series forecasting methods, specifically considered for Cryptocurrencies price such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR) and Cardano (XRP), and devises a procedure to evaluate their performance. Time series data are collected and examined using descriptive statistics. In next step, the White Neural Network is used for Non-Linearity and Dickey-Fuller for nonstationary and correlation among different settings of datasets. Based on these analyses, we evaluate efficient financial forecasting models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric, Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal (TBATS) and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) with reference to different parameters configuration of these models. The performance is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) criterion and models are ranked by statistical mean and standard deviation of MAPE values. The NNAR model gives minimum MAPE of 2.823 while the minimum convergence time of 4.9835s is observed with TBATS and hence, these are ranked at top amongst other models respectively. These results underpin that neural network-based models perform equally well on both types of nonlinear and linear financial data and, thus, have the potential to improve the impact of financial transaction and cryptocurrencies price bringing more innovation in the decision making process. © 2022 IEEE.","ARIMA; Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies Forecasting; Ethereum; NNAR; TBATS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85142278046

Therefore, one of the most popular methods that have been used to predict cryptocurrency prices is sentiment analysis. It is a widespread technique utilized by many researchers on social media platforms, particularly on Twitter. Thus, to determine the relationship between investors’ sentiment and the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, this study forecasts the cryptocurrency prices using the Long-Term-Short-Memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm. In addition, Twitter users’ sentiments using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) machine learning approaches are analyzed. As a result, in the classification of the bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) datasets of investors’ sentiments into (Positive, Negative, and Neutral), the SVM algorithm outperformed the NB algorithm with an accuracy of 93.95% and 95.59%, respectively.

Most monetary businesses now include cryptocurrency. Accordingly, cryptocurrency trading is widely regarded as the most of prevalent and capable types of lucrative investments. However, because this financial sector is already known for its extreme volatility and quick price changes, over brief periods of time. For such constantly changing nature of crypto trends and price, it has become a necessary part for traders and crypto enthusiast to get a detailed analysis before investing. Also, the construction of a precise and dependable forecasting model is regarded vital for portfolio management and optimization. In this paper we propose a web system, which will help to understand cryptocurrency in a more statistical way. Proposed system focuses mainly on four coins : Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu performing analysis and forecasting on all the four coins. System will also do statistical comparison between the coins. Analysis and comparison is carried out using python libraries and modules whereas LSTM and ARIMA are used for forecasting. Extensive research was conducted using real-time and historical information, on four key cryptocurrencies, two of which had the greatest market capitalization, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, while the other, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, that had a significant growth in market capitalization over the previous year.

Due to its enormous success, a great number of cryptocurrencies were created in the upcoming years. This exponential growth relies mostly on the extreme volatility of the market, which led many people to become interested and get involved, primarily for profit. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts tend to share and learn news and opinions on social media platforms, one of the most popular being Twitter. In this paper, we study the extent to which Twitter sentiment analysis can be used to predict price fluctuations for cryptocurrencies. Initially, we gathered tweets and price data of seven of the most popular cryptocurrencies, which were processed to perform sentiment analysis using Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER). The time-series stationarity was determined with Augmented Dicky Fuller (ADF) Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin (KPSS) tests and then Granger Causality testing took place. While price fluctuations seem to cause sentiment for Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP and Doge, predictability was found for Ethereum and Polkadot, based on a bullishness ratio. Finally, predictability of price returns is examined with Vector Autoregression (VAR) and highly accurate forecasts for two of the seven cryptocurrencies were achieved. More specifically, price forecasts of Ethereum's and Polkadot's prices reached 99.67% and 99.17% accuracy, respectively. © 2022 IEEE.","Augmented Dicky Fuller (ADF); Bullishness; Cryptocurrency; Forecasting; Granger Causality test; Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin (KPSS); Prediction; Sentiment Analysis; Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER); Vector Autoregression (VAR)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85141027958

BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems. We also present a conceptual architecture TAIRA-BSC proof of concept that is developed to serve as a foundation for future studies focused on enhancing trust in AI applications through the integration of BCT. © 2022 IEEE.","AI trust; Artificial intelligence (AI); Blockchain technology (BCT); data exchange; Data Lake (DL); distributed ledger technology; recruiting; recruiting workflow; secure; smart contracts; transparency",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139950128

However, Bitcoin's erratic behavior has discouraged some potential investors. To get insights into its behavior and price fluctuation, past studies have discovered the correlation between Twitter sentiments and Bitcoin behavior. Most of them have exclusively focused on their relationships, instead of the Twitter sentiment analysis itself. Finding the most suitable classification algorithms for sentiment analysis for this kind of data is challenging. For the enormous data in Twitter, the supervised sentiment analysis approach of unlabeled data can be time-consuming and expensive, which has been studied to be superior to unsupervised ones. As such, we propose the HyVADRF (hybrid valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner (VADER)-random forest) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) model. A semantic and rule-based VADER was used to calculate polarity scores and classify sentiments, which overcame the weakness of manual labeling, while a random forest was utilized as its supervised classifier. Furthermore, considering Twitter's massive size, we collected over 3.6 million tweets and analyzed various dataset sizes as these are related to the model's learning process. Lastly, GWO parameter tuning was conducted to optimize the classifier's performance. The results show that 1) the HyVADRF model had an accuracy of 75.29%, precision of 70.22%, recall of 87.70%, and F1-score of 78%. 2) The most ideal dataset size percentage is 90% of the total collected tweets ( n =1 ,249,060). 3) The standard deviations are 0.0008 for accuracy and F1-score and 0.0011 for precision and recall. Hence, the HyVADRF model consistently delivers stable results. © 2013 IEEE.","bitcoin; gray wolf optimization; Hyperparameter; random forest; tweet sentiment analysis; VADER",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139397887

With the enhancement of machine learning algorithms and increased computational capabilities, machine learning has proved one of the most efficient cryptocurrency prediction methods. However, most studies focused on single digital currency prediction or small-scale algorithm comparison for multiple currencies. This study aims to present a comparative performance of large-scale selected Machine Learning algorithms for cryptocurrency forecasting. Specifically, this paper concentrates on forecasting time series data for a short-term trading period in ten cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, XRP, DOGE, LUNA, LINK, LTC, and BCH) with ten selected machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Bayesian Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine). Our experiment results show that the Gradient Boosting with the mean square error criterion is superior in predicting most major cryptocurrencies by performing statistical analysis and data visualizations. Additionally, the Random Forest and Decision Tree model built by the Classification and Regression Tree algorithm also shows outstanding performance in certain currencies such as ETH, XRP, LUNA, and LTC. Thus, all three algorithms can help anticipate the short-term evolutions of the cryptocurrency market. © 2022 IEEE.","cryptocurrency; forecasting; machine learning; supervised learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138003456

Traffic profiles are constructed by machine-learning (ML) algorithms using the series of packet sizes and arrival times of QUIC connections. Thus, the proposed QoS method does not require explicit setup of a path (i.e. it provides soft QoS), but employs agents within the network to verify that flows conform to a given traffic profile.

Blockchain is the foundation of cryptocurrency, but the applications of blockchain technology are much more expansive. This technology is considered to be a revolutionary solution for the financial industry. Also, it can be successfully applied in scenarios involving data validation, auditing, and sharing. On the other hand, machine learning is one of the most noticeable technologies in recent years. Both technologies are data-driven, and thus there are rapidly growing interests in integrating them for more secure and efficient data sharing and analysis. This paper shows how these two technologies, blockchain and machine learning, can be combined in predicting bitcoin volatility. To analyze and predict bitcoin volatility, bitcoin data from real-time series and random forests as a machine learning algorithm were used. When predicting bitcoin volatility, low statistical errors were obtained in the training and test set.

Cryptocurrency price prediction is a challenging problem with non-stationary market price and volatility clustering. Cryp-tocurrency data tends to be non-stationary, which means that predictive information extracted using deep learning techniques on observed data can not be used with future data. Moreover, there is a very little signal in cryptocurrency data to indicate the future direction of the market. This paper proposes a sensible way to frame the prediction problem as a dynamic regression problem by defining the features in the feedforward neural networks and the target as an appropriate average of the historical data. The novelty of this paper is to use deep learning algorithms and statistical bootstrapping to obtain cryptocurrency price prediction and the corresponding prediction intervals. It is shown that neural networks are capable of modelling nonlinearity directly for nonlinear time series models. The proposed hybrid approach is evaluated using simulated and cryptocurrency data through numerical experiments. Moreover, Gaussian and boot-strap prediction intervals for the price and the volatility of the prediction errors, are also discussed in some detail. © 2022 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency; Neural network; Prediction intervals; Sign model; Weak market signal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136947004

Under these circumstances, in countries with cheap or subsidized electricity price, the introduction of profitable cryptocurrencies application is deeply penetrated. It has attracted many low-voltage customers to mine these digital currencies individually or in mining pools. The employed mining devices with their own unique constant load profile have escalated the coincident factor of the loads supplied by a transformer. This can highly overload the transformers engaged with loads of this type and, in the long term will cause destructive impacts not only on the transformer also on the distribution facilities. This paper studies the adverse effect of cryptocurrency mining loads on the distribution transformer aging. At first, the customer's profit analysis through mining operation has been introduced, realizing different electric energy pricing strategies. Finally, 105 real-world distribution substations have been monitored over one year, and their actual load profiles data are recorded for analysis. A relation between the penetration rate of the mining devices and the transformer's expected lifetime is determined in this work. It is shown that the distribution transformers' expected lifetime will decrease by 25% in the presence of only a 5% penetration rate of cryptocurrency miners. This is an alarming statistic for distribution networks operating under the presence of cryptocurrency mining loads. This should be strictly addressed in the future planning of these distribution networks. © 2022 IEEE.","aging; b itco in; blockchain; cryptocurrency; distribution transformer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136081205

Traditional methods usually involve the measurement of the source project and the target project. However, due to the limitations of laws and regulations, these original data are not easy to obtain, which forms a data island. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) has great advantages in training heterogeneous data and data island. In order to solve the data island and data heterogeneity of HDP, we propose a novel Federated Reinforcement Learning via Gradient Clustering (FRLGC) method in this paper. Firstly, the parameters of the global model are transferred to each dueling deep Q network (dueling DQN) model and each client uses private data to train the dueling model which combines experience replay to increase data efficiency in limited datasets. Secondly, gaussian differential privacy is used to encrypt the model parameters to ensure the privacy and security of the model. Finally, we cluster the clients according to their locally encrypted model parameters and use weighted average to aggregate to create a new global model locally and globally. Experiments on nine projects in three public databases (Relink, NASA and AEEEM) show that FRLGC is superior to the relevant HDP solutions. © 2013 IEEE.","Data island; experience replay; federated reinforcement learning; Gaussian differential privacy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135754729

Predicting changes in cryptocurrency price is a hugely important topic to investors and researchers, with much existing research on demand-side factors. The goal of this research project is to design and implement machine learning models to predict future cryptocurrency price change direction based primarily on supply-side factors. Different unsupervised machine learning techniques are used to build the predictive models. These techniques include K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayesian Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. A dataset of 10 daily supply-side metrics for three prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin) at four different time horizons (ranging from one day to 30 days) are used to build and test the machine learning models. The outputs of these models indicate the predicted direction of the price movement over the time horizon (i.e., whether the price would go up or down), not the magnitude of the movement. Experimental results show that predictions were very unreliable for the shorter time spans but very reliable for the longest time spans. The Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest classifiers consistently outperformed the other techniques and achieved a prediction accuracy of over 90% in most models and over 95% in the best models.

We exploit the reusability of weight values in the hidden dense layers of an MLP model in an existing domain, to further decrease the required resources in training an MLP in another domain. Here a domain represents the the CRP space of a given strong PUF instance. We support our proposed Transfer Learning method with simulated data of some variants of XOR Arbiter PUF.

However, existing schemes still employ a pixel predictor that ignores pixel changes in the diagonal direction during prediction, and the pixel labeling scheme is inflexible. To solve these problems, this paper proposes reversible data hiding in encrypted images based on adaptive prediction and labeling. First, we design an adaptive gradient prediction (AGP), which uses eight adjacent pixels and combines four scanning methods (i.e., horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and diagonal) for prediction. AGP can adaptively adjust the weight of the linear prediction model according to the weight of the edge attribute of the pixel, which improves the prediction ability of the predictor for complex images. At the same time, we adopt an adaptive huffman coding labeling scheme, which can adaptively generate huffman codes for labeling according to different images, effectively improving the scheme's embedding performance on the dataset. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a higher embedding rate. The embedding rate on the test image Jetplane is 4.2102 bpp, and the average embedding rate on the image dataset Bossbase is 3.8625 bpp. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The network provides interactive voice and data telecommunication services for air traffic control in the region and, as such, requires high availability and performance. Outages do not only result in a degradation of service, but they also constitute safety risks.While network optimization in networks is typically the result of parameter measurements, more sophisticated and advanced solutions rely on real-time deep packet inspections to derive optimization parameters.However, Air Traffic Control (ATC) networks in the future will be protected by end-to-end encryption algorithms such as TLS or DTLS. That means that deep packet inspection will not be possible anymore, and the data plane can only see up to the transport layer information (port numbers), but not deeper.Different methods for network optimizations are needed. This paper describes an algorithm that uses Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to predict the probability of transmission errors in the satellite link communication. This prediction can then be used to perform such network optimizations. The ML concept described predicts the symbol energy-to-noise power density [energy per bit] of a satellite link.The complete satellite link performance data is combined with associated, regional weather data to create training samples for a regression type machine learning prediction. The training samples contain history and future windows so that the trained neural network is able to perform sequence to sequence predictions to output the predicted future symbol energy-to-noise power density.During the training a Tree Parzen hyperparameter optimizer is used to select the best fitting neural network topology and training parameters like neuron number or optimizer learning rate. Machine learning pipelines allow the execution of necessary data manipulation steps like sample filtering of invalid samples, interpolating missing sample values or necessary normalization.The concept was validated as part of the SINAPSE research project in the MEVA III network. The completed hyperparameter training of 30 models demonstrates that the trend of the energy-to-noise power density can be predicted correctly in many cases.

Its great predictive power requires extensive computation, which encourages model owners to host the prediction service in a cloud platform. This article proposes a CNN prediction scheme that preserves privacy in the outsourced setting, i.e., the model-hosting server cannot learn the query, (intermediate) results, and the model. Similar to SecureML (S&P'17), a representative work that provides model privacy, we employ two non-colluding servers with secret sharing and triplet generation to minimize the usage of heavyweight cryptography. We made the following optimizations for both overall latency and accuracy. 1) We adopt asynchronous computation and SIMD for offline triplet generation and parallelizable online computation. 2) As MiniONN (CCS'17) and its improvement by the generic EzPC compiler (EuroS&P'19), we use a garbled circuit for the non-polynomial ReLU activation to keep the same accuracy as the underlying network (instead of approximating it in SecureML prediction). 3) For the pooling in CNN, we employ (linear) average-pooling, which achieves almost the same accuracy as the (non-linear, and hence less efficient) max-pooling exhibited by MiniONN and EzPC. Considering both offline and online costs, our experiments on the MNIST dataset show a latency reduction of 122×, 14.63×, and 36.69× compared to SecureML, MiniONN, and EzPC; and a reduction of communication costs by 1.09×, 36.69×, and 31.32×, respectively.

Proteome-wide identification of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) has proven valuable in the systematic understanding of the genome-phenome relationship. However, the PPIs of C. parvum are largely unknown because of the limited experimental studies carried out. Therefore, we took full advantage of three bioinformatics methods, i.e., interolog mapping (IM), domain-domain interaction (DDI)-based inference, and machine learning (ML) method, to jointly predict PPIs of C. parvum. Due to the lack of experimental PPIs of C. parvum, we used the PPI data of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), which owned the largest number of PPIs in Apicomplexa, to train an ML model to infer C. parvum PPIs. We utilized consistent results of these three methods as the predicted high-confidence PPI network, which contains 4,578 PPIs covering 554 proteins.

So to overcome this issue we develop a hybrid secure algorithm which encrypts the patient personal information which they wish not to share to anyone outside the hospital by crypto AES encryption and hashing using SHA-256 and then storing the data in database which will be accessible only to the patient and the doctor. Together with encryption of the patient personal data and medical data our proposed system will effectively evaluate the data by a trained machine learning model to check whether a person is actually suffering from diabetes or not. We use logistic regression for evaluating the patient medical data to predict the health status so mistakes can be avoided in prediction as the prediction is done by the trained machine. Then doctor can give the treatment depending on the health status. As a result this system will give a sustainable solution to people for safely transmitting their personal data as well as medical data through wireless medium along with diabetes disease prediction. © 2022 IEEE.","AES Encryption; Disease Prediction; Logistic regression; SHA-256",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130093282

Different amalgams of IoT devices and ML mechanisms are available for medical sector but are limited to certain domains only. These models either provide patients current state data or specific domain analyzing and surveillance pre/post treatment data like heart or brain functions with corresponding medical aid. Also data available is used as clinical study for medical professionals and for better understandings of patients about their state. Specific domain gadgets' like wrist bands or smart bands uses some sensors about vital, temperature and pulse etc., checkups are available but they were not meant for diagnosing or for treatments. In this paper, we proposed an integrated model to use IoT and ML algorithms for a healthcare system. Tracking of patients' status can be done using some sensors such as lightweight, portable, and low-powered sensor nodes. These Sensors sense the patient's status and send the parametric data to the central controller, to take actions during the critical condition of the patients. The data sent to the controller always provided in secure and encryption form. At the same time, patient data is sent to doctors, so that they can provide the instructions to the caretakers of the patients with quick and proper solutions in real-time. For disease prediction, our model uses supervised machine learning algorithms, In order to get the efficient feature set and improve the better accuracy, and pre-processing techniques to eliminate features that are irrelevant, missing values and outliers from biomedical data which aids in better disease prediction. To further strengthen the proposed integrated model design is compared with various traditional classification algorithms to specify its improved accuracy and computational time for accurate prediction of the patient's disease and acts as a decision support system for health care assistants. © 2022 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.","classification; decision-support systems; feature selection; IoT; machine learning; security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130059337

According to authoritative literature, the occurrence of diabetes may be related to a person's age, living environment, living habits, genes, past medical history and other factors. We can get more accurate models through machine learning training on a large amount of data, but in order to protect patients' private information between different hospitals, it is impossible to conduct training directly through data transmission. In view of this situation, we propose a solution combining homomorphic encryption and federated learning, and design and implement a privacy-protected diabetes prediction system based on federated learning. The experimental results demonstrated that it broke the phenomenon of information isolation among hospitals and successfully collected patient information from different hospitals, which could not only improve the accuracy of the trained model, but also effectively protect the privacy of patients. Therefore, this work is very innovative and practical, and has strong practical and application significance under the current social background. It can provide solutions for diabetes treatment in the medical field in the future, and it is expected to provide new ideas for multi-party data combination in different fields in the future. © 2022 IEEE.","Disease prediction system; Federated learning; Homomorphic encryption; Paillier encryption scheme",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129627553

Cryptocurrency works similar to standard currency, however, virtual payments are made for goods and services without the intervention of any central authority. Although cryptocurrency ensures legitimate and unique transactions by utilizing cryptographic methods, this industry is still in its inception and serious concerns have been raised about its use. Analysis of the sentiments about cryptocurrency is highly desirable to provide a holistic view of peoples' perceptions. In this regard, this study performs both sentiment analysis and emotion detection using the tweets related to the cryptocurrency which are widely used for predicting the market prices of cryptocurrency. For increasing the efficacy of the analysis, a deep learning ensemble model LSTM-GRU is proposed that combines two recurrent neural networks applications including long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). LSTM and GRU are stacked where the GRU is trained on the features extracted by LSTM. Utilizing term frequency-inverse document frequency, word2vec, and bag of words (BoW) features, several machine learning and deep learning approaches and a proposed ensemble model are investigated. Furthermore, TextBlob and Text2Emotion are studied for emotion analysis with the selected models. Comparatively, a larger number of people feel happy with the use of cryptocurrency, followed by fear and surprise emotions. Results suggest that the performance of machine learning models is comparatively better when BoW features are used. The proposed LSTM-GRU ensemble shows an accuracy of 0.99 for sentiment analysis, and 0.92 for emotion prediction and outperforms both machine learning and state-of-the-art models. © 2013 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency; emotion analysis; machine learning; sentiment analysis; Text2Emotion",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128253293

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation.

IoT integrated cloud computing technology can be used in smart cities, health care, smart homes, environmental monitoring, etc. In recent days, IoT integrated cloud can be used in the health care system for remote patient care, emergency care, disease prediction, pharmacy management, etc. but, still, security of patient data and disease prediction accuracy is a major concern. Numerous machine learning approaches were used for effective early disease prediction. However, machine learning takes more time and less performance while classification. In this research work, the Attribute based Searchable Honey Encryption with Functional Neural Network (ABSHE-FNN) framework is proposed to analyze the disease and provide stronger security in IoT-cloud healthcare data. In this work, the Cardiovascular Disease and Pima Indians diabetes dataset are used for heart and diabetic disease classification. Initially, means-mode normalization removes the noise and normalizes the IoT data, which helps to enhance the quality of data.

In cryptocurrencies, records are stored using a cryptographic algorithm.The main aim of this research was to develop an optimal solution for predicting the price of cryptocurrencies based on user opinions from social media. Twitter is used as a marketing tool for cryptoanalysis owing to the unrestricted conversations on cryptocurrencies that take place on social media channels. Therefore, this work focuses on extracting Tweets and gathering data from different sources to classify them into positive, negative, and neutral categories, and further examining the correlations between cryptocurrency movements and Tweet sentiments. This paper proposes an optimized method using a deep learning algorithm and convolution neural network for cryptocurrency prediction; this method is used to predict the prices of four cryptocurrencies, namely, Litecoin, Monero, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The results of analyses demonstrate that the proposed method forecasts prices with a high accuracy of about 98.75%.The method is validated by comparison with existing methods using visualization tools. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Therefore, protecting these WSN networks from Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) is one of the WSN networks security tasks. Traditional packet deep scan systems that rely on open field inspection in transport layer security packets and the open field encryption trend are making machine learning-based systems the only viable choice for these types of attacks. This paper contributes to the evaluation of the use machine learning algorithms in WSN nodes traffic and their effect on WSN network life time. We examined the performance metrics of different machine learning classification categories such as K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gboost, Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on a WSN-dataset in different sizes. The test results proved that the statistical and logical classification categories performed the best on numeric statistical datasets, and the Gboost algorithm showed the best performance compared to different algorithms on average of all performance metrics. The performance metrics used in these validations were accuracy, F1-score, False Positive Ratio (FPR), False Negative Ratio (FNR), and the training execution time. Moreover, the test results showed the Gboost algorithm got 99.6%, 98.8%, 0.4% 0.13% in accuracy, F1-score, FPR, and FNR, respectively. At training execution time, it obtained 1.41 s for the average of all training time execution datasets. In addition, this paper demonstrated that for the numeric statistical data type, the best results are in the size of the dataset ranging from 3000 to 6000 records and the percentage between categories is not less than 50% for each category with the other categories. Furthermore, this paper investigated the effect of Gboost on the WSN lifetime, which resulted in a 32% reduction compared to other Gboost-free scenarios. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

There are several efforts conducted to forecast the price of items using classic machine learning algorithms and statistical models. These models can predict prices of various financial instruments, e.g., gold, oil, cryptocurrencies, stocks, and second-hand items. Despite these efforts, the literature has no model for predicting the prices of seasonal goods (e.g., Christmas gifts). In this context, we framed the task of seasonal goods price prediction as a regression problem. First, we utilized a real online trailer dataset of Christmas gifts and then we proposed several machine learning-based models and one statistical-based model to predict the prices of these seasonal products. Second, we utilized a real-life dataset of Christmas gifts for the prediction task. Then, we proposed support vector regressor (SVR), linear regression, random forest, and ridge models as machine learning models for price prediction. Next, we proposed an autoregressive-integrated-moving-average (ARIMA) model for the same purpose as a statistical-based model. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the proposed models; the comparison shows that the best performing model was the random forest model, followed by the ARIMA model. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

With the continuous exploitation of data value and the proliferation of machine learning-as-a-service, convolutional neural network prediction schemes on privacy preservation have been introduced one after another, which makes much more attention focused on the privacy leakage and services offered to be efficient and light. Therefore, how to improve the convolutional neural prediction scheme on the premise of privacy preservation turns out to be an imperative research issue. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving convolutional neural network prediction scheme (PCP-LL) that supports low latency and lightweight users. The scheme starts from the perspective of lossless accuracy from underlying networks. First, we construct a secure activation function computing protocol (SActF) utilizing a commodity-based secure comparison protocol, which reduces the complexity and latency during the activation function computing under ciphertexts compared with common schemes. Second, to further support lightweight users, we introduce a secure output layer protocol (SOut) that enables users to obtain the prediction results without extra decryption after simple operations. Then, the scheme adopts the distributed two trapdoors public-key cryptosystem (DT-PKC) to achieve both data and model security, which well avoids security issues especially such as wiretapping by semi-honest participants commonly in secret sharing schemes. Finally, through relevant evaluations, the scheme not only achieves privacy preservation and low latency, but also supports lightweight users. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","CNN; homomorphic encryption; prediction; privacy preservation; secret sharing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113896239

Although traditionally trading was done by professionals, nowadays a majority of market participants are market-data processing bots due to their inherent advantages in processing large amounts of data, lack of emotions of fear or greed, and predicting market prices through artificial intelligence. A large number of approaches have been brought forward to tackle this task, many of which rely on specially engineered deep learning methods with a focus on specific market conditions. The general limitation of these approaches, however, is the reliance on customized gradient-based methods which limit the scope of possible solutions and don't necessarily generalize well when solving similar problems. This paper proposes a method which uses neuroevolutionary techniques capable of automatically customizing offspring neural networks, generating entire populations of solutions and more thoroughly exploring and parallelizing potential solutions. Our approach uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve increasingly improved populations of neural networks which, based on sentimental and technical analysis data, efficiently predict future market price movements. The effectiveness of this approach is validated by testing the system on both live and historical trading scenarios, and its robustness is tested on other cryptocurrency and stock markets.

However, its volatility and brand new trading mode has made it challenging to devising an acceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm — proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning.

The blockchain is a tamper-evident, unforgeable distributed ledger that protects security and privacy through the famous algorithm zk-SNARK, which is also widely used in virtual digital currencies such as Zcash. In addition, by using zk-SNARK technology in the Loopring DEX 3.0 in Ethereum, not only decentralization but also transaction performance can be guaranteed. However, there are three main problems of zk-SNARK, one is the need to guarantee calculation accuracy, two is the long time to generate evidence, especially when using Lagrangian interpolation to QAP the transaction data requires more computation; the last is the poor scalability, especially when nodes need to recalculate all data when adding new transactions. In this paper, we propose a modified zk-SNARK based on Newtonian interpolation, improve the QAP part of zk-SNARK by Newtonian interpolation, and verify the correctness of the scheme through instantiation. Finally, we analyze the computational efficiency of the two interpolation methods, and the results show that Newton interpolation solves the above two problems in the original zk-SNARK, and significantly reduces the time complexity of the algorithm, which can further promote the application of blockchain in data management of AIoT. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","AIoT; Blockchain; Newton interpolation; Zero knowledge proof; ZK-SNARK",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115329635

In this work, we propose a new complete framework for enhancing deep learning time-series models, which is based on a data preprocessing methodology. The proposed framework focuses on conducting a sequence of transformations on the original low-quality time-series data for generating high-quality time-series data, “suitable” for efficiently training and fitting a deep learning model. These transformations are performed in two successive stages: The first stage is based on the smoothing technique for the development of a new de-noised version of the original series in which every value contains dynamic knowledge of the all previous values. The second stage of transformations is performed on the smoothed series and it is based on differencing the series in order to be stationary and be considerably easier fitted and analyzed by a deep learning model. A number of experiments were performed utilizing time-series datasets from the cryptocurrency market, energy sector and financial stock market application domains on both regression and classification problems. The comprehensive numerical experiments and statistical analysis provide empirical evidence that the proposed framework considerably improves the forecasting performance of a deep learning model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Deep Learning; Forecasting; Stationarity; Time-series",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105479030

Such prediction is critical for security and network monitoring applications as they require application type to be known in prior. Traditional ways using port-based or payload-based analysis are not sufficient anymore as many applications start using dynamic unknown port numbers, masquerading, and encryption techniques to avoid being detected. Recently, machine learning has gained significant attention in many prediction applications including traffic classification from flow features or characteristics. However, such algorithms suffer from an imbalanced data problem where some applications have fewer flow data and hence difficult to predict. In this paper, we employ network flow-level characteristics to identify the application type of traffic. Furthermore, we propose the use of an improved support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, named cost-sensitive SVM (CMSVM), to solve the imbalance problem in network traffic identification. CMSVM adopts a multi-class SVM algorithm with active learning which dynamically assigns a weight for applications. We examine the classification accuracy and performance of the CMSVM algorithm using two different datasets, namely MOORE_SET and NOC_SET datasets. Our results show that the CMSVM algorithm can reduce computation cost, improve classification accuracy and solve the imbalance problem when compared to other machine learning techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CMSVM; Imbalance problem; Machine learning; NETFLOW flow; SVM; Traffic classification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105338385

This primitive is desirable for key generation and authentication in constrained devices, due to its low power and low area overhead. However, in recent years many research papers are focused on the vulnerability of PUFs to modeling attacks. This attack is possible because the PUFs challenge and response exchanges are usually transmitted over communication channel without encryption. Thus, an attacker can collect challenge-response pairs and use it as input into a learning algorithm, to create a model that can predict responses given new challenges. In this paper we introduce a serial and a parallel novel 64-bits memory-based controlled PUF (Mc-PUF) architecture for device authentication that has high uniqueness and randomness, reliable, and resilient against modeling attacks. These architectures generate a response by utilizing bits extracted from the fingerprint of a synchronous random-access memory (SRAM) PUF with a control logic. The synthesis of the serial architecture yielded an area of 1.136K GE, while the parallel architecture was 3.013K GE. The best prediction accuracy obtained from the modeling attack was ~50%, which prevents an attacker from accurately predicting responses to future challenges. We also showcase the scalability of the design through XOR-ing several Mc-PUFs, further improving upon its security and performance. The remainder of the paper presents the proposed architectures, along with their hardware implementations, area and power consumption, and security resilience against modeling attacks. The 3-XOR Mc-PUF had the greatest overhead, but it produced the best randomness, uniqueness, and resilience against modeling attacks. © 2021 IEEE.","Authentication; Constrained devices; Mc-PUF; Modeling attack; Resilient; Security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115684108

As a consequence, one of the WSN-related security tasks is to protect them from Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. Machine learning-based systems are the only viable option for these types of attacks, as traditional packet deep scan systems depend on open field inspection in transport layer security packets and the open field encryption trend. Moreover, network data traffic will become more complex due to increases in the amount of data transmitted between WSN nodes as a result of increasing usage in the future. Therefore, there is a need to use feature selection techniques with machine learning in order to determine which data in the DoS detection process are most important. This paper examined techniques for improving DoS anomalies detection along with power reservation in WSNs to balance them. A new clustering technique was introduced, called the CH_Rotations algorithm, to improve anomaly detection efficiency over a WSN’s lifetime. Furthermore, the use of feature selection techniques with machine learning algorithms in examining WSN node traffic and the effect of these techniques on the lifetime of WSNs was evaluated. The evaluation results showed that the Water Cycle (WC) feature selection displayed the best average performance accuracy of 2%, 5%, 3%, and 3% greater than Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Harmony Search (HS), and Genetic Algorithm (GA), respectively. Moreover, the WC with Decision Tree (DT) classifier showed 100% accuracy with only one feature. In addition, the CH_Rotations algorithm improved network lifetime by 30% compared to the standard LEACH protocol.

The purpose of this research is to investigate blockchain technology to explore its trends according to their classification by use of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) database. Furthermore, we particularly evaluate the registered patents in the world's most well-known patent databases such as the USA patent database. We drew the current technology trends in blockchain patents by applying the text mining and clustering approach. The results represent that the registered patents in the USA patent database have been achieved in the growth phase. That means, attention to the blockchain is rising nowadays and most patents focused the cryptocurrencies and their applications in finance.

However, the development and implementation of RES entail various challenges, e.g., dealing with grid stability issues due to RES’ intermittency. Correspondingly, increasingly volatile and even negative electricity prices question the economic viability of RES-plants. To address these challenges, this paper analyzes how the integration of an RES-plant and a computationally intensive, energy-consuming data center (DC) can promote investments in RES-plants. An optimization model is developed that calculates the net present value (NPV) of an integrated energy system (IES) comprising an RES-plant and a DC, where the DC may directly consume electricity from the RES-plant. To gain applicable knowledge, this paper evaluates the developed model by means of two use-cases with real-world data, namely AWS computing instances for training Machine Learning algorithms and Bitcoin mining as relevant DC applications. The results illustrate that for both cases the NPV of the IES compared to a stand-alone RES-plant increases, which may lead to a promotion of RES-plants. The evaluation also finds that the IES may be able to provide significant energy flexibility that can be used to stabilize the electricity grid. Finally, the IES may also help to reduce the carbon-footprint of new energy-intensive DC applications by directly consuming electricity from RES-plants. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency mining; Data center; Edge computing; Energy flexibility; Energy informatics; Integrated energy system; Machine learning; Renewable energy sources",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102026991

Given the recent growth of Ethereum, the cryptocurrency community and researchers are interested in understanding the Ethereum transactions behavior. In this work, we investigate a key aspect of Ethereum: the prediction of a transaction confirmation or failure based on its features. This is a challenging issue due to the small, but still relevant, fraction of failures in millions of recorded transactions and the complexity of the distributed mechanism to execute transactions in Ethereum. To conduct this investigation, we train machine learning models for this prediction, taking into consideration carefully balanced sets of confirmed and failed transactions. The results show high-performance models for classification of transactions with the best values of F1-score and area under the ROC curve approximately equal to 0.67 and 0.87, respectively.

This objective requires to specify whether investors can extend their exposure in certain asset classes and benefit their portfolios in a statistically significant way. In this paper, we address this issue of diversification in the context of cryptoasset portfolios and examine whether their risk-adjusted performance can be enhanced through seeking exposure into the commodities class. For an equally-weighted portfolio of five cryptoassets, we first consider the addition of physical gold, as conceptualised by the CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index, a diversified, monthly-rebalanced index that seeks exposure to both asset classes. We further consider modifying the index composition by replacing physical gold with a basket of five commodities. Mean-variance spanning tests reveal that the addition of physical gold in the original cryptoasset portfolio translates to a significant shift in the efficient frontier, both in terms of the global minimum variance and the tangency portfolios. Additionally, expanding the exposure in the commodity side confirms a statistically significant improvement, with the diversification benefit arising from a shift in the tangency portfolio. We further generate a number of price paths for the original index, the modified index and their components, according to a Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH specification, to assess the efficiency of the index weighted risk contribution scheme. Results demonstrate a superior performance of the two indices when compared against their constituents in terms of Omega ratio. The modified index appears more appropriate for investors that seek higher annual returns, while the original composition would be more appropriate for individuals with moderate annual return goals. © 2021 IEEE.","Commodities; Cryptoassets; Diversification; Gold; Index; Mean-Variance Spanning",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114503273

The format in this paper is a time series analysis of the daily high-low-close of digital currency. The algorithms used for such analysis is LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) which is part of Deep Learning and further Fbprophet which is an Auto Machine Learning for prediction is used. The metric used for the analysis of the algorithm is MAE (Mean Absolute Error). The programming language used is Python, which solves the majority of use cases. © 2021 IEEE.","Cryptocurrencies; Deep-Learning; Fbprophet; Long-Short-Term-Memory; Prediction; Python; Time-Series-Analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104649750

The goal was achieved implementing different machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost (XGB), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Macroeconomic variables data were gained from Yahoo Finance website spanning a 4-year interval with a hourly resolution, while technical indicators data are provided by the python talib library. The variance problem on test samples has been taken into account through the cross validation technique which also allowed to evaluate a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. Furthermore, the Grid Search technique was used to find the best hyperparameters values for each implemented algorithm. The results were evaluated in terms of the well known classification metrics, i.e. accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score. Based on the results, it was possible to demonstrate that the unrestricted case outperforms the restricted one, verifying that the addition of the technical indicators to the macroeconomic variables actually improves the accuracy on Bitcoin price classification. © 2021 IEEE.","blockchain; cryptocurrencies; machine learning; time series analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106602841

New bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that the demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Actually, the price is highly volatile, because it is affected by many factors including the supply of bitcoin, its market demand, the cost of the mining process, as well as economic and political world-class news. In this work, we illustrate a novel approach for bitcoin trend prediction, based on the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). First, we propose a methodology for building useful datasets that take into account social media data, the full blockchain transaction history, and a number of financial indicators. Moreover, we present a cloud-based system characterized by a highly efficient distributed architecture, which allowed us to collect a huge amount of data in order to build thousands of different datasets, using the aforementioned methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses 1D CNN for bitcoin trend prediction. Remarkably, an efficient and low-cost implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNN models that perform one-dimensional convolutions (i.e., scalar multiplications and additions). We show that the 1D CNN model we implemented, trained, validated and tested using the aforementioned datasets, allow one to predict the bitcoin trend with higher accuracy compared to LSTM models. Last but not least, we introduce and simulate a trading strategy based on the proposed 1D CNN model, which increases the profit when the bitcoin trend is bullish and reduces the loss when the trend is bearish. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; CNN; Financial indicators; Sentiment analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099260255

Crypto is the buzzword nowadays where people worldwide are investing their money in a digital payment transaction and have ticked all the boxes when it comes to cases such as security, seemingly fast transactions, and has quickly emerged as one the world's fastest-growing financial markets. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency launched in 2009 showcased the proof of work of a decentralised system and what blockchain is capable of doing in a digital ecosystem. Scope: Our paper aims at suggesting currencies to future investors based on the sentiments on popular social media and predicting the overall growth of any coin to analyze its growth prospects. Method: In this paper, we have attempted a meticulous approach to predict the price movements in cryptocurrencies considering its fluctuating factors. Since no unique model can predict the market changes effectively, we focussed on creating a SETP (Sentiment Evaluation for Trend Prediction) model, which analyzes the sentiment surrounding the crypto market and the apprehensions that engulf an investor while investing. The statistical data analysis of the top 5 coins in the market has been undertaken effectively using IBM Watson services. Further enhancements have been made using the jupyter notebook to predict the market highs of the top trending coins. The sentimental evaluation has been done by extracting Twitter trends and hashtags thereby judging the sentiments of the microblogging site and paving a way to predict the exact emotion of investors all over the globe. Findings: Finally, we believe that this research has immense capability to predict the market speculation using the various technologies that are still in the rudimentary phase and has a lot of potential in invoking the interest of researchers and providing useful data/cognizance for future investors. © 2021 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency; Data Analysis; Machine Learning; Prediction; Sentiments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126978266

Like other financial stock markets, cryptocurrency has become a new sensation and challenge for investors to predict its behaviour. However, unlike other financial instruments, cryptocurrency has been renowned because of the difficulty to predict the price due to its volatility behaviour that changes so rapidly and since there is no fundamental economy for its value. This paper presents a performance comparison of two ML algorithms in predicting Ethereum price with non-time series analysis, which are k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and multiple polynomial regression (MPR). The experiment used independent variables from related real-world economic fundamentals such as Dow Jones Index, gold price, oil price, and Ethereum volume. The experiment data was collected from the records from April 2017 until April 2021. For each algorithm, several methods of preprocessing data were used to match all independent data with the dependent data. Three different preprocessing scenarios were also used to find the maximum accuracy model. scenario 1 (feature selection based on correlation matrix), scenario 2 (feature selection based on correlation with the dependent variables and among independent variables), and scenario 3 (scenario 1 extracted with PCA). The performance of the compared methods was evaluated by using MSE and MAE. From the experiment, a comparison of results using two different models with k-NN and multiple polynomial regression is obtained. It is found that k-NN with a hyperparameter K = 2 have the best prediction with MSE = 449.032 and MAE = 14.282 compared with multiple polynomial regression with the best MSE = 13953.96 and MAE = 84.923. ©2021 IEEE","crypocurrency; k-NN; multiple polynomial regression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126971766

Cryptocurrencies were introduced to eliminate financial intermediaries leading to direct peer-To-peer transactions. With the spread of the global Coronavirus pandemic, the relationship between Bitcoin and the equity market has expanded. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile but can also prove to be good investments. Cryptocurrency, being a novel technique for transaction systems, has led to a lot of confusion among investors and any rumours or news on social media has been claimed to significantly affect the prices of cryptocurrencies. The huge percentage increase/decrease in Bitcoin's price over a short period of time is an intriguing phenomenon that cannot be foreseen. For a long time, bitcoin price prediction has been a hot topic of study.In this paper, we discuss the implementation and results of the Deep Learning Bitcoin Price Prediction Model and prepare a strategy to maximize gains for investors. The paper covers to framework with a set of deep learning models, analysis methods with a fixed set of factors to predict daily Bitcoin prices and design-integration of price prediction of different cryptocurrencies using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated recurrent units). The idea of incorporating Public Sentiment in the prediction of the hikes and falls of the Bitcoin market from Social Media platforms like Reddit and Twitter leading to meaningful predicted results. This prediction can bring confidence to the common man to invest with lesser risk and more profit. Also, this can enable the digital new-Age currency to become a primary method of transaction. © 2021 IEEE.","bitcoin; cryptocurrency; GRU; lexicon model; LSTM; MAE; MSE; RNN; sentiment analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126441090

Next, we apply BERT-based embedding to generate word vectors, cluster the vectors to create latent economic concepts, and propose a document representation based on the distribution of words on these concepts as well as news sentiment. We use a recurrent convolutional neural network to jointly use BERT-based text representation and technical indicators embedding for market time series prediction.

It is not managed by a government or a bank. It's a digital file that can be shared from one user to the next. Bitcoin's popularity has risen in recent years, and many people have begun to invest in it. Since investment on bitcoin is increasing day to day and the bitcoin price fluctuates frequently, traders need a way to predict its price in prior so that the risks associated with it can be reduced and capital gain can be improved. The various existing works on price prediction have low accuracy and predict short term price only. Due to the difficulty of determining the exact existence of a Time Series model, it is difficult to generate appropriate forecasts. The Proposed technique uses deep learning to predict bitcoin prices with Recurrent Neural Network model using the time series data to provide the better accuracy. The novelty of work is to obtain a long-term prediction, the recurrent neural network model is trained and tested on the available dataset. This work predicts the value of bitcoin for the year 2021.

The results across different time scales are tested for noise using permutation entropy technique, empirical estimations are represented in statistical complexity plane to show the structure of efficiency links. Usage of AMIM in short window estimation is justified. Efficiency levels seem to be closely connected if judged from the standpoint of information theory at all time frames.

There has been a huge increase in the number of cryptocurrencies in the past few years. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have become an interesting subject of study in fields such as finance. In 2021, over 4,000 cryptocurrencies are already listed. There are many past studies that focus on predicting the price of cryptocurrencies using machine learning, but the majority of them only focused on Bitcoin. Moreover, the majority of the models implemented for price prediction only used the historical market prices, and do not utilize social signals related to the cryptocurrency. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for predicting the prices of dogecoin cryptocurrency. The proposed model is based on historical market price data as well as social trends of Dogecoin cryptocurrency. METHODS: The market data of Dogecoin is collected from Kaggle on the granularity of a day and for the same duration the verified tweets have also been collected with hashtags “Dogecoin” and “Doge”. Experimental results show that the proposed model yields a promising prediction of future price of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that has recently become the talk of the town of the crypto market. RESULTS: Minimum achieved RMSE in predicted price of Dogecoin was 0.02 where the feature vector consisted of OCVP (Open, Close, Volume, Polarity) values from combined dataset. RESULTS: Experimental results show that the proposed approach performs efficiently. © 2021. Basant Agarwal et al., licensed to EAI.

One of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market right now being Bitcoin, was first invented to solve the inherent problem with using traditional currency when purchasing online. However, unexpectedly Bitcoin soon found itself to be one of the most profitable investment opportunities to be hedged on with its yearly growth unrivaled by any traditional investment product such as stocks, bonds, or real-estate. However, unlike the stock market which has been the subject of multitude of research papers, the cryptocurrency market has not been treated the same way and as such there is still a huge opportunity open in this industry. Thus, Bitcoin Vision wants to utilize this opportunity and propose the use of machine learning and deep learning architecture to predict the price movement trend of bitcoin (up or down) for the short-term prediction and predict the price of bitcoin for the long-term prediction. Being able to predict the future of the market prove to be useful in the stock market and as such this paper decide to replicate that opportunity to be presented in the cryptocurrency market as well.

In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem. © 2021 The Authors.

The most optimal type of system using the methods of system analysis is determined for the designed one among the chosen analogues, for which a tree of goals was built as well as to highlight the main goals and specific actions for each stage of system development to fully perform, selected evaluation criteria, etc. Data-flow diagrams have been created to describe the primary process that runs in the system and smaller ones, which do a necessary job for the successful functioning of the immediate circle and the system in general. Also, a diagram of the hierarchy of tasks is built. Before the direct development of the software of the designed system, a comparative analysis is performed to determine which programming language is best suited for such system, necessary frameworks and libraries to use, integrated development environment and other software to be used in the development of the system. As a result of the development of the system, a client-server architecture application running on the Node.js platform is created.

In these stock market investments, investors use fundamental analysis tools and indicators very widely. In this way, it is possible to have some knowledge of the situations experienced in the markets and to make a profit. In this study, manipulations on Bitcoin are discussed. Popular machine and statistical forecasting methods have been used to detect these manipulations and the road maps to be followed in order to be detected in the most successful way have been shared. Social media sentiments, which were thought to have an effect on manipulations during the studies, were also evaluated with the most advanced text analysis methods and evaluated together with these price changes. The allegations that the prediction methods carried out before the crisis were more successful were investigated. The Covid-19 pandemic was evaluated as a period of global crisis and the studies that might be relevant were examined. It would not be wrong to say that the actors that make big gains in the stock markets are the ones that determine the direction of the stock market. The manipulation periods of the market actors to be successful in the virtual money markets have been tried to be verified by various estimation methods. These estimations can achieve up to F1 score of 93% success according to our experimental result. Besides, it is stated that accounts with the highest volume of transactions in the periods, when anomalies were detected, were labeled as potential manipulators. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

One such new trend that promises the endurance is the Cloud computing. Computing resources offered by the Cloud includes the servers, networks, storage, and applications, all as services. With the advent of Cloud, a single application is delivered as a metered service to numerous users, via an Application Programming Interface (API) accessible over the network. The services offered via the Cloud are such as the infrastructure, software, platform, database and web services. The main motivation of this application model is to provide computationally secure key generation to protect the data via encryption. This key generation in the cryptography process falls into three categories in this research work. In the first part, SVM based encryption service model is constructed for which the key generation is from the conventional encryption operation mode with some improvements. To make the process more complex, the optimization techniques are taken into account for the key generation in descendant two methods application model that acts computationally more secure specifically for Cloud environment. The results of security analysis confirm the effectiveness of the proposed application model withstands potentially against various attacks such as Chosen Cipher Attack, Chosen Plain text Attack indistinguishable attacks for files. In case of images, it resists well against statistical and differential attacks.

However short-term trades may entail high profits if traders open and close the correct positions. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies, and in particular of Bitcoin, is what made cryptocurrency trading so profitable in these last years. The main goal of this work is to compare several frameworks each other to predict the daily closing Bitcoin price, investigating those that provide the best performance, after a rigorous model selection by the so-called k-fold cross validation method. We evaluated the performance of one stage frameworks, based only on one machine learning technique, such as the Bayesian Neural Network, the Feed Forward and the Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks, and that of two stages frameworks formed by the neural networks just mentioned in cascade to Support Vector Regression. Results highlight higher performance of the two stages frameworks with respect to the correspondent one stage frameworks, but for the Bayesian Neural Network. The one stage framework based on Bayesian Neural Network has the highest performance and the order of magnitude of the mean absolute percentage error computed on the predicted price by this framework is in agreement with those reported in recent literature works. © 2021.

One of the major components that leads to the successful compromising of the targeted system is malicious software. It allows using the victim's machine for various nefarious purposes, e.g., making it a part of the botnet, mining cryptocurrencies, or holding hostage the data stored there. At present, the complexity, proliferation, and variety of malware pose a real challenge for the existing countermeasures and require their constant improvements. That is why, in this paper we first perform a detailed meta-review of the existing surveys related to malware and its detection techniques, showing an arms race between these two sides of a barricade. On this basis, we review the evolution of modern threats in the communication networks, with a particular focus on the techniques employing information hiding. Next, we present the bird's eye view portraying the main development trends in detection methods with a special emphasis on the machine learning techniques.

Recent trends in the evolution of Internet traffic present a challenge for traditional traffic analysis methods to achieve accurate classification of Internet traffic including Voice over IP (VoIP), text messaging, video, and audio services among others. A key aspect of this trend is the rising levels of encrypted multiple service channels where the payload is opaque to middleboxes in the network. In such scenarios, traditional approaches such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) or examination of Port numbers are unable to achieve the classification accuracy required. This work investigates Machine Learning-based network traffic classifiers as a means of accurately classifying encrypted multiple service channels.

Among all security threats, the hardware trojan (HT) inserted into the integrated circuit is one of the most concerns. As a flexible and nondestructive approach, the side-channel analysis techniques are widely used for HT detection. However, noise sensitivity and golden chip dependence make side-channel based approaches face greatly challenge in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel HT detection approach based on Isolation Forest, which provides high precision detection capability, while reducing the dependence of the golden chip. First, we perform special preprocessing, named Main Difference Accumulation (MDA), on the side-channel information to magnify the impacts of HT. Then, we train the isolation forest model using the processed information. During the test phase, the obtained model can score the test data. Finally, we complete the detection of HT based on the score and threshold. Moreover, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to achieve the automatic selection of the threshold in the isolation forest. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, we select the power signal as the side-channel information and insert four different kinds of HTs into the AES-128 crypto core. Results obtained using a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA board show that the accuracy of HT detection can reach 100%, with a 1.13% relative area ratio of the original circuit. © 2020 IEEE.","hardware trojan detection; Isolation Forest (iForest); side-channel analysis (SCA)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101508169

We consider developers’ comments and activity for two major blockchain projects, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, extracted from Github. We measure sentiment and emotions (joy, love, anger, etc.) of the developers’ comments over time, and test the corresponding time series (i.e. the affect time series) for correlations and causality with the Bitcoin/Ethereum time series of prices. Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers’ emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price.

It allows people to trade directly without going through financial institutions such as banks. This model results in many transactions that occur outside the law and beyond ethical constraints. In such an anonymous environment, the large number of entities using Bitcoin, and the huge scale of the Bitcoin trading network make it difficult for users to have a rough idea of the entire trading network before transaction. Thus, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to summarize the research problems, achievements and possible research trends based on Bitcoin data analysis. Therefore, in this paper we review the literatures about data analysis on Bitcoin transaction entities. Starting from the relevant conceptual framework of Bitcoin, this paper divides the existing research models into three categories, heuristic algorithm identification of entities, transaction descriptive statistics and network analysis, and visual system analysis. By analyzing the transaction entity, Bitcoin transaction data can be processed in a manner which is similar to an account, such as a bank or credit card, thereby achieving the purpose of in-depth analysis of all transaction activities related to the account entity. Finally, we summarize the data analysis results of Bitcoin transaction network and prospects of the future research directions. © 2020 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Data Analysis; Transaction Entity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097532906

However, current prediction systems compromise one party's privacy: either the user has to send sensitive inputs to the service provider for classification, or the service provider must store its proprietary neural networks on the user's device. The former harms the personal privacy of the user, while the latter reveals the service provider's proprietary model. We design, implement, and evaluate Delphi, a secure prediction system that allows two parties to execute neural network inference without revealing either party's data. Delphi approaches the problem by simultaneously co-designing cryptography and machine learning. We first design a hybrid cryptographic protocol that improves upon the communication and computation costs over prior work. Second, we develop a planner that automatically generates neural network architecture configurations that navigate the performance-Accuracy trade-offs of our hybrid protocol. Together, these techniques allow us to achieve a 22x improvement in online prediction latency compared to the state-of-The-Art prior work. © 2020 Owner/Author.","neural architecture search; neural networks; secure inference",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096978186

However, although federated learning uses encrypted security aggregation, its decentralised nature makes it vulnerable to malicious attackers. A deliberate attacker can subtly control one or more participants and upload malicious model parameter updates, but the aggregation server cannot detect it due to encrypted privacy protection. Based on these problems, we find a practical and novel security risk in the design of federal learning. We propose an attack for conspired malicious participants to adjust the training data strategically so that the weight of a certain dimension in the aggregation model will rise or fall with a pattern. The trend of weights or parameters in the aggregation model forms meaningful signals, which is the risk of information leakage. The leakage is exposed to other participants in this federation but only available for participants who reach an agreement with the malicious participant, i.e., the receiver must be able to understand patterns of changes in weights.

Therefore, privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) aims at providing privacy using techniques such as secure multi-party computation (SMPC). Recent years have seen a rapid influx of cryptographic frameworks that steadily improve performance as well as usability, pushing PPML towards practice. However, as it is mainly driven by the crypto community, the PPML toolkit so far is mostly restricted to well-known neural networks (NNs). Unfortunately, deep probabilistic models rising in the ML community that can deal with a wide range of probabilistic queries and offer tractability guarantees are severely underrepresented. Due to a lack of interdisciplinary collaboration, PPML is missing such important trends, ultimately hindering the adoption of privacy technology. In this work, we introduce CryptoSPN, a framework for privacy-preserving inference of sum-product networks (SPNs) to significantly expand the PPML toolkit beyond NNs. SPNs are deep probabilistic models at the sweet-spot between expressivity and tractability, allowing for a range of exact queries in linear time. In an interdisciplinary effort, we combine techniques from both ML and crypto to allow for efficient, privacy-preserving SPN inference via SMPC. We provide CryptoSPN as open source and seamlessly integrate it into the SPFlow library (Molina et al., arXiv 2019) for practical use by ML experts. Our evaluation on a broad range of SPNs demonstrates that CryptoSPN achieves highly efficient and accurate inference within seconds for medium-sized SPNs. © 2020 ACM.","privacy-preserving inference; secure computation; sum-product networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096956953

The malicious actors use cryptocurrency malware to perform complex computational tasks using infected devices.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) learning model for hunting cryptocurrency malware threats. Specifically, our proposed model utilizes the RNN to analyze Windows applications’ operation codes (Opcodes) as a case study. We collect a real-world dataset that comprises of 500 cryptocurrency malware and 200 benign-ware samples, respectively. The proposed model trains with five different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) structures and is evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) technique. The obtained results prove that a 3-layer configuration model gains 98% of detection accuracy, which is the highest rate among other current configurations.

Our framework integrates two main techniques to guarantee individual privacy.

Therefore, there have been many proposals to use certificateless signature scheme, machine learning approaches, public key encryption as well as blockchain to improve the security of IIoT.

Transcriptomic analysis of blood samples has emerged as a potential means to identify biomarkers and gene signatures of PD. In this context, classification algorithms can assist in detecting data patterns such as phenotypes and transcriptional signatures with potential diagnostic application. In this study, we performed gene expression meta-analysis of blood transcriptome from PD and control patients in order to identify a gene-set capable of predicting PD using classification algorithms. We examined microarray data from public repositories and, after systematic review, 4 independent cohorts (GSE6613, GSE57475, GSE72267 and GSE99039) comprising 711 samples (388 idiopathic PD and 323 healthy individuals) were selected. Initially, analysis of differentially expressed genes resulted in minimal overlap among datasets. To circumvent this, we carried out meta-analysis of 17,712 genes across datasets, and calculated weighted mean Hedges' g effect sizes. From the top-100- positive and negative gene effect sizes, algorithms of collinearity recognition and recursive feature elimination were used to generate a 59-gene signature of idiopathic PD. This signature was evaluated by 9 classification algorithms and 4 sample size-adjusted training groups to create 36 models. Of these, 33 showed accuracy higher than the non-information rate, and 2 models built on Support Vector Machine Regression bestowed best accuracy to predict PD and healthy control samples.

A major factor driving this phenomenon is the proliferation of large networks of poorly secured IoT devices. This is exacerbated by the commoditization of the malware development industry, in which tools can be readily obtained in specialized hacking forums or underground markets. However, despite the great interest in targeting this infrastructure, there is little understanding of what the main features of this type of malware are, or the motives of the criminals behind it, apart from the classic denial of service attacks. This is vital to modern malware forensics, where analyses are required to measure the trustworthiness of files collected at large during an investigation, but also to confront challenges posed by tech-savvy criminals (e.g., Trojan Horse Defense). In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of Linux-based malware. Our study is tailored to IoT malware and it leverages automated techniques using both static and dynamic analysis to classify malware into related threats. By looking at the most representative dataset of Linux-based malware collected by the community to date, we are able to show that our system can accurately characterize known threats. As a key novelty, we use our system to investigate a number of threats unknown to the community. We do this in two steps. First, we identify known patterns within an unlabeled dataset using a classifier trained with the labeled dataset. Second, we combine our features with a custom distance function to discover new threats by clustering together similar samples. We further study each of the unknown clusters by using state-of-the-art reverse engineering and forensic techniques and our expertise as malware analysts.

Although it can be used in several research areas, such as medical and financial, this paradigm introduces new security and privacy problems. In response to the ciphertext classification requirements in different scenarios in outsourcing environments, this paper proposed an outsourced privacy-preserving decision tree classification model based on homomorphic encryption, which can hide sensitive inputs (model and query) and outputs (analytic result) from a counterparty. A secure exclusive OR (XOR) protocol is created; it intelligently computes the XOR of two bit-encrypted data to obtain another bit-encrypted result.

Detection based on features of network traffic and machine learning algorithms is a common approach to identify malicious events. The performance of approaches is associated with the used features and algorithms. In this paper, we propose MalFinder, an ensemble learning-based framework for malicious traffic detection. Considering the trend of network traffic encryption and the complexity of decrypting traffic, we utilize statistical features and sequence features to describe network traffic. We extend the dimensions of these two types of features to enhance their capability for representing traffic data. Feature importance analysis and contrast experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our new features. Among our selected classifiers suitable for malicious traffic detection, boosting-based classifiers XGBoost and LightGBM can reduce bias, and bagging-based classifier Random Forest can reduce variance. Stacking, which is the integration method of the classification results used in our framework, can improve the generalization ability of the method. MalFinder can achieve 96.58% F-measure and 95.44% accuracy in the malicious traffic detection task on a real-world dataset, whose results are better than those of comparison methods. In terms of unseen malicious traffic discovery, MalFinder still provides good performance with 93.46% F-measure and 91.04% accuracy, which even surpasses the results in the task of known malicious traffic detection of other comparative methods.

Forecasting the Bitcoin price as accurate as possible is essential, but due to its high volatility this task is challenging. Many researchers try, through the years, to develop efficient models for predicting the Bitcoin price using several different data-driven approaches. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel decomposition-ensemble learning model that combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) with machine learning algorithms to forecast the Bitcoin price multi-step ahead. The algorithms are k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel, Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with single-layer perceptron, Generalized Linear Model, and Cubist.

Asset pricing is a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders. Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature.

PIs are susceptible to monetary losses in the open market due to the aforementioned issues. The fraudsters could be both internal (operator of the scheme) and external (financial institutions (FI), such as banks, money-lenders, and insurance companies). The centrality of trust among stakeholders like PI, CF, and FI is a prime concern. Motivated from these facts, this paper proposes a decentralized framework, KaRuNa, A Blockchain-based Sentiment analysis framework for Fraud Cryptocurrency schemes. KaRuNa operates on public blockchain three phases of trust modeling among stakeholders. In the first phase, transactions are performed on the blockchain that offers trust, auditability, and transparency among stakeholders. In the second phase, sentiment analysis (SA) of cryptocurrencies is proposed based on a novel algorithm of hash addresses to generate classification scores (CS). Parameters like social trends, rise/fall in cryptocurrency price, measured standard deviation, peak and low are selected to fed to proposed novel Long-short term memory (LSTM) classifier to generate recommendations based on CS. An accuracy of 98.99% is achieved using LSTM over generated CS to evaluate risks in the investment.

This is because of the massive usage of end-to-end security protocols over Internet such as HTTPS and QUIC. The encryption trend will continue to rapidly increase in the future, and this trend concerns video streaming applications as well. Network providers face a serious challenge in managing their networks due to such widespread deployment of end-to-end security protocols. These operators need to have a clear visibility into traffic on their networks to monitor and manage both quality of experience (QoE)-and-service (QoS) impairments in popular video streaming services, in the most effective and efficient manner. Moreover, so many factors that influence QoE need to be taken care of to get an acceptable user experience. Most of the existing solutions use the deep packet inspection to infer these factors from the encrypted traffic. However, these solutions are inefficient, most of the time, leading to low QoE inference accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine-learning based solution that leverages a random forest classifier for a better QoE inference accuracy. The proposed solution uses network-and-transport layer information to infer QoE factors such as startup delay and stall events. It helps the network providers to react quickly and in real time for any impairments in the QoE of the encrypted video traffic. We evaluate our solution using an HTTP adaptive streaming service (YouTube) that uses HTTPS and QUIC protocols.

The employment ofWikipedia to trace crypto assets value need examination because the portal allows gathering of different opinions-content of the articles is edited by a group of people. Consequently, the information can be more attractive and useful for the readers than in case of non-collaborative sources of information. Wikipedia Articles often appears in the premium position of such search engines as Google, Bing, Yahoo and others. One may expect different demand on information about particular cryptocurrency depending on the different events (e.g., sharp fluctuations of price). Wikipedia offers only information about cryptocurrencies that are important from the point of view of language community of the users inWikipedia. This ""filter"" helps to better identify those cryptocurrencies that have a significant influence on the regional markets. The models encompass linkages between different variables and properties. In one model cryptocurrency projects are ranked with the means of articles sentiment and quality. In another model, Wikipedia visits are linked to cryptocurrencies' popularity. Additionally, the interactions between information demand in different Wikipedia language versions are elaborated. They are used to assess the geographical esteem of certain crypto coins. The information about the legal status of cryptocurrency technologies in different states that are offered by Wikipedia is used in another proposed model. It allows assessment of the adoption of cryptocurrencies in a given legislature. Finally, a model is developed that joins Wikipedia articles editions and deletions with the social sentiment towards particular cryptocurrency projects. The mentioned analytical purposes that permit assessment of the popularity of blockchain technologies in different local communities are not the only results of the paper. The models can show which country has the biggest demand on particular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin and others. © 2020 by the authors.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Information demand; Information quality; Wikipedia",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085584770

Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","cryptocurrencies; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media; speculative models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075481457

As supporting homomorphic operations over encrypted data without decryption, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) contributes to machine learning classification without leaking user privacy, especially in the outsouring scenario. In this paper, we propose an improved FHE scheme based on HElib, which is a FHE library implemented based on Brakerski's FHE scheme. Our improvement focuses on two aspects. On the one hand, we first use the relinearization technique to reduce the ciphertext size, and then the modulus switching technique is used to reduce the modulus and decryption noise. On the other hand, we need no relinearization and modulus switching if there is additive homomorphic or no homomorphic operation in the multiplicative ciphertext's next homomorphic operation. Homomorphic comparison protocol, private hyperplane decision-based classification and private Naïve Bayes classification are implemented by additive homomorphic and multiplicative homomorphic first. In our homomorphic comparison protocol, the number of interactions is reduced from 3 to 1. We choose the proposed FHE scheme to implement private decision tree classification. Simulation results show that the efficiency of our FHE scheme and implementation of private decision tree classification are more efficient than other two schemes. © 2013 IEEE.","decision tree; fully homomorphic encryption; hyperplane decision-based; Machine learning classification; Naïve Bayes; privacy preserving",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041666841

Specifically, we use two econometric models to perform a two-layer analysis to study the correlation and prediction of Bitcoin and Ether price series with traditional assets. In the first part of this study, we model the probability of positive returns via a Bayesian logistic model. Even though the fitting performance of the logistic model is poor, we find that traditional assets can explain some of the variability of the price returns. Along with the fact that standard models fail to capture the statistic and econometric attributes-such as extreme variability and heteroskedasticity-of cryptocurrencies, this motivates us to apply a novel Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov model to these series. In particular, we model Bitcoin and Ether prices via the non-homogeneous Polya-Gamma Hidden Markov (NHPG) model, since it has been shown that it outperforms its counterparts in conventional financial data. The transition probabilities of the underlying hidden process are modeled via a logistic link whereas the observed series follow a mixture of normal regressions conditionally on the hidden process. Our results show that the NHPG algorithm has good in-sample performance and captures the heteroskedasticity of both series. It identifies frequent changes between the two states of the underlying Markov process. In what constitutes the most important implication of our study, we show that there exist linear correlations between the covariates and the ETH and BTC series. However, only the ETH series are affected non-linearly by a subset of the accounted covariates. Finally, we conclude that the large number of significant predictors along with the weak degree of predictability performance of the algorithm back up earlier findings that cryptocurrencies are unlike any other financial assets and predicting the cryptocurrency price series is still a challenging task. These findings can be useful to investors, policy makers, traders for portfolio allocation, risk management and trading strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

Since key points are random and sparse, their randomness needs to be investigated to predict key points reliably. Based on measure theory, we propose an event mapping model to formally define this randomness and express it in a low dimensional and normalized space Q through mapping functions. Interestingly, when mapping functions are monotonic, the probability of a key event can be approximated by those of nested random events in Q. Based on this finding, we designed a long short-term memory based neural network to learn the mapping functions and derived an asymptotic statistical learning (ASL) algorithm. ASL automatically analyzes the convergence of random events in space Q and makes point estimates on key events in trading. Compared with 12 existing algorithms on six real datasets from NYSE, S&P 500, NASDAQ, cryptocurrency markets, etc., the algorithm ASL reliably predicts sparse key events from many random events, which provides a method to deal with the imbalance classification problem in predicting key events in trading. ASL significantly outperforms other algorithms under different market situations in both bull and bear markets. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Asymptotic Statistical Learning; Key Trading Events; Monotonic Measure; Random Event Prediction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081336688

One of the usages of blockchain is in digital currencies. Digital currency (cryptocurrency) is a new era for the global financial system. Cryptocurrencies draw significant attention from researchers because of their advantages. Although there are several risks (e.g., speculation, 51% attack) related to cryptocurrency, billions of dollars are invested in them, because of their transparency, traceability, low transaction cost, and highly profitable potential. In December 2017, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached almost $20,000.00 per coin. Such short-term, high gain potential attracts many new small investors. However, speculative movements raise many questions related to the safety and privacy of investors, just to name a few. To understand public opinions about cryptocurrency and speculative movements to protect small investors financial interests, sentiment analysis can be done by using social media activities of individuals who are interested or investing in cryptocurrencies. It is also one of the essential steps in the analysis to understand the profiles of the users. Therefore, in this paper, we determine the attitudes of social network users by analyzing the positivity and negativity of the comments about six cryptocurrencies. Results show that the positivity is higher than negativity, and there exist relations between price changes and attitudes. However, relations vary according to currency types.

The right action is related to massive stock market measurements. Therefore, defining the right action requires specific knowledge from investors. The economy scientists, following their research, have suggested several strategies and indicating factors that serve to find the best option for trading in a stock market. However, several investors' capital decreased when they tried to trade the basis of the recommendation of these strategies. That means the stock market needs more satisfactory research, which can give more guarantee of success for investors. To address this challenge, we tried to apply one of the machine learning algorithms, which is called deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on the stock market.

Bitcoin was introduced as the first cryptocurrency to allow direct online payments without relying on centralized financial entities. The use of Bitcoin has vastly grown as a financial asset rather than just a tool for online payments. A lot of cryptocurrencies have been created since 2011 with Bitcoin dominating the cryptocurrencies' market. With plenty of cryptocurrencies being used as financial assets and with millions of trades being executed through different exchange services, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to trading problems and challenges similar to those traditionally encountered in the financial domain. Price and trend prediction, volatility prediction, portfolio construction and fraud detection are some examples related to trading.

This paper develops different text preprocessing strategies for correlating the sentiment scores of Twitter text with Bitcoin prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the effect of different preprocessing functions, features, and time lengths of data on the correlation results. Out of 13 strategies, we discover that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices.

This paper introduces an alternative approach in applying machine learning to block cipher cryptanalysis. Rather than trying to extract secret keys, machine learning classifiers are trained to predict a cipher's security margin with respect to the number of active s-boxes. Prediction is based on cipher features such as the number of rounds, permutation pattern, and truncated differences. Experiments are performed on a simplified generalised Feistel structure (GFS) block cipher. Prediction accuracy is optimised by refining how cipher features are represented as training data, and tuning hyperparameters. Results show that the machine learning classifiers are able formulate a relationship between the cipher features and security. When used to predict an unseen cipher (a cipher whose data was not used for training), an accuracy of up to 62% was obtained, depicting the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2020 ACM.","Active s-box; Block cipher; Differential cryptanalysis; Linear classifier; Machine learning; Security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092623519

It made Bitcoin a very profitable market for investment but Bitcoin saw many ups and down as well. Today's Bitcoin price is 3913 USD but that doesn't mean that the prices always keep falling. The price of Bitcoin vary over time and is governed by various factors, like the market it is being traded in, scarcity, supply and demand. What has made Bitcoin valuable is that it can be used as a currency, we can pay a part or a fraction of Bitcoin to a person in exchange for something and the part is easily verifiable by blockchain. The small number of Bitcoin, roughly 16 million Bitcoins for the entire world has made it scare and above that its high utility makes it more prestigious.Trading of Bitcoin has proved to be very profitable to many people but the risk in trading is huge as the market of Bitcoin is very volatile. To decrease the risks, this project has been carried out to predict the price of Bitcoin using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Linear Regression(LR) to predict the price of Bitcoin. Evaluation of these algorithms is carried out to determine which among the two is better for the prediction of Bitcoin prices. The dataset used contains minute by minute prices of Bitcoin of over 5 years and contains almost 30,00,000 entries. Since, the dataset used is a big data, evaluating the performance of algorithms over a large dataset will give accurate results. © 2020 IEEE.","Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; Linear regression; Long short term memory; Recurrent neural network",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091747411

However, current prediction systems compromise one party's privacy: either the user has to send sensitive inputs to the service provider for classification, or the service provider must store its proprietary neural networks on the user's device. The former harms the personal privacy of the user, while the latter reveals the service provider's proprietary model. We design, implement, and evaluate DELPHI, a secure prediction system that allows two parties to execute neural network inference without revealing either party's data. DELPHI approaches the problem by simultaneously co-designing cryptography and machine learning. We first design a hybrid cryptographic protocol that improves upon the communication and computation costs over prior work. Second, we develop a planner that automatically generates neural network architecture configurations that navigate the performance-accuracy trade-offs of our hybrid protocol.

Accurate Diagnosis of cancer is essential in treating it properly. Medical tests regarding cancer in recent times are quite expensive and not available in many parts of the world. CryptoNets, on the other hand, is an exhibit of the use of Neural-Networks over data encrypted with Homomorphic Encryption. This project demonstrates the use of Homomorphic Encryption for outsourcing neural-network predictions in case of Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL). By using CryptoNets, the patients or doctors in need of the service can encrypt their data using Homomorphic Encryption and send only the encrypted message to the service provider (hospital or model owner). Since Homomorphic Encryptions allow the provider to operate on the data while it is encrypted, the provider can make predictions using a pre-trained Neural-Network while the data remains encrypted all throughout the process and finally sending the prediction to the user who can decrypt the results. During the process the service provider (hospital or the model owner) gains no knowledge about the data that was used or the result since everything is encrypted throughout the process. Our work proposes a Neural Network model which will be able to predict ALL-Acute Lymphoid Leukemia with approximate 80% accuracy using the C_NMC Challenge dataset. Prior to building our own model, we used the dataset and pre-process it using a different approach. We then ran on different machine learning and Neural Network models like VGG16, SVM, AlexNet, ResNet50 and compared the validation accuracies of these models with our own model which lastly gives better accuracy than the rest of the models used. We then use our own pre-trained Neural Network to make predictions using CryptoNets. We were able to achieve an encrypted prediction of about 78% which is close to what we achieved when validating our own CNN model that has a validation accuracy of 80% for prediction of Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL). © Science and Information Organization.","Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL); CryptoNets; Homomorphic; Neural network",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087839144

It is considered as the chronic disease which is caused by an increase in blood sugar. If diabetes remains unidentified and untreated, it creates more complexities. So, the early prediction of diabetes can reduce the fatal rate of a human. The data mining concept assists to diagnose diabetes. Various research studies are presented with various data mining algorithms for early prediction and disease diagnosis but still with lack of accuracy. At the same time, mining the diabetes data in a secure manner is one of the critical issues. To recover this issue, this paper designs the new model for early prediction of diabetes with high accuracy. This research explores the enhanced principal component analysis for efficient feature extraction from the dataset. To achieve the highest accuracy of classification, it has proposed the machine learning algorithm, namely, modified support vector machine (MSVM) which is used to detect the diabetes disease at an early stage. The main contribution of this research is to mining the patient’s disease results in cloud security. For this security purpose, honey bee encryption and decryption algorithm is used. The performance measures of the proposed method are evaluated on various measures of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and negative predictive value. Results obtained show the proposed MSVM classifier outperforms with the highest accuracy of 97.13%.

Because of its digital nature, Bitcoin cannot be valuated exclusively with fundamental approaches, which is why factors such as investor sentiment have become a common alternative to capture its performance. In this work, we studied whether and how the sale of Bitcoins from the insolvency assets of Mt.Gox, which represent about 1.1% of the current global total, relates to Bitcoin price movements. We used social media sentiment analysis of Twitter data to examine how investors are influenced in their decision to buy or sell Bitcoin when confronted with the trade actions of Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee in charge of the Mt.Gox case. We built a vector error correction model to analyse the long-run relationship between cointegrated variables. Our analysis confirms the positive association of Bitcoin performance with positive Twitter sentiment and tweet volume and the negative association with negative sentiment. We further found empirical evidence that Mt.Gox selloff events have a lasting negative impact on the Bitcoin price and that we can measure this effect by Twitter sentiment and tweet volume. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

At any time, MHS could be enabled as Wi-Fi Hotspot in mobility devices (smart phone, tablet) with cellular backhaul network (3G/4G/5G) and provides Internet access to client devices such as laptop, TV etc. Unlike Wi-Fi Access Point, which is typically a powered device, MHS is enabled as battery-operated device. In addition, MHS consumes higher power and reported as one of the primary Voice of Customer (VoC) issue. Due to high power consumption, many customers are skeptical about MHS feature and its continuous usage. Apart from few literatures, there is no specific IEEE 802.11 standard for MHS and its power management.

MLaaS applications often rely on centralised collection and aggregation of user data, which could lead to significant privacy concerns when dealing with sensitive personal data. To address this problem, we propose PrivEdge, a technique for privacy-preserving MLaaS that safeguards the privacy of users who provide their data for training, as well as users who use the prediction service. With PrivEdge, each user independently uses their private data to locally train a one-class reconstructive adversarial network that succinctly represents their training data. As sending the model parameters to the service provider in the clear would reveal private information, PrivEdge secret-shares the parameters among two non-colluding MLaaS providers, to then provide cryptographically private prediction services through secure multi-party computation techniques. We quantify the benefits of PrivEdge and compare its performance with state-of-the-art centralised architectures on three privacy-sensitive image-based tasks: individual identification, writer identification, and handwritten letter recognition. Experimental results show that PrivEdge has high precision and recall in preserving privacy, as well as in distinguishing between private and non-private images. Moreover, we show the robustness of PrivEdge to image compression and biased training data.

Together with mobile, flexible and highly scalable amounts of devices, these structures form the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the Internet of Everything (IoE) and Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). However, the key enabler of this development - wireless communication - comes along with drawbacks in the form of new attack vectors and security threats. Due to the open nature and broadcast characteristic, it is especially prone to miscellaneous cyber-attacks, such as eavesdropping. Just because of this, it is a huge challenge to develop and integrate sound and secure communication between doubtless authenticated entities. Since conventional security depends on complex computations as well as overhead within the communication itself, Physical Layer Security (PhySec) offers a worthwhile solution to face these tasks. Furthermore, the application of Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) such as Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE+) and the Fifth Generation (5G) are capable to overcome the constraints of bandwidth limitations. 5G with its benefits of high data rates, low latency, an operation in almost real-time and the microcell approach, is a promising solution for future industrial networks. Besides that, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables new possibilities to utilize inherent given information of the wireless channel and to train models to predict their behaviour and strengthen the generation of a shared secret between two communicating entities. Within this work, PhySec methods are applied to derive symmetric cryptographic credentials and establish a trustful communication. This is done by using a real-world implementation of an NGMN testbed to evaluate the proposed adaptions. AI in the form of the Linear Regression Algorithm (LRA), is applied to enhance the estimated channel model. The results prove the suitability of Channel-PUFs, the benefits of the AI improvements of the Channel Measurement in the Secret Key Generation (SKG) algorithm and the huge overall potential to secure future industrial and private networks. And this, moreover, in a resource efficient and secure manner. The approach is a low cost, efficient and resource-saving alternative to conventional security mechanisms. © 2020. the authors.

To mine the rich value involved in big data, the machine learning methodology is widespread employed due to its ability to adapt to data changes. However, the data mining process may involve the privacy issues of the users, hence they are reluctant to share their information. This is the reason why the outsourced data need to be dealt with securely, where data encryption is considered to be the most straightforward method to keep the privacy of data, but machine learning on the data in ciphertext domain is more complicated than the plaintext, since the relationship structure between data is no longer maintained, in such a way that we focus on the machine learning over encrypted big data. In this work, we study locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), a widely used classic machine learning algorithm in real-world, such as predict and find the best-fit curve through numerous data points. To tackle the privacy concerns in utilizing the LWLR algorithm, we present a system for privacy-preserving locally weighted linear regression, where the system not only protects the privacy of users but also encrypts the best-fit curve. Therefore, we use Paillier homomorphic encryption as the building modular to encrypt data and then apply the stochastic gradient descent in encrypted domain. After given a security analysis, we study how to let Paillier encryption deal with real numbers and implement the system in Python language with a couple of experiments on real-world data sets to evaluate the effectiveness, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art and occurs negligible errors compared with performing locally weighted linear regression in the clear. © 2013 IEEE.","Locally weighted linear regression; paillier homomorphic encryption; privacy-preserving; stochastic gradient descent",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078447886

In this study, price prediction is performed with two machine learning methods, namely linear regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM), by using a time series consisting of daily ether cryptocurrency closing prices. Different window lengths are used in ether cryptocurrency price prediction by using filters with different weight coefficients. In the training phase, a cross-validation method is used to construct a high-performance model independent of the data set. The proposed model is implemented using two machine learning techniques. When using the proposed model, the SVM method has a higher accuracy (96.06%) than the LR method (85.46%).

Furthermore, to analyze streaming IoT data swiftly, they are in need of a fast and efficient system. The Paper will envision the aspects of complexity dealing with real time data from various devices in parallel, building solution to ingest data from different IOT devices, forming a secure platform to process data in a short time, and using various techniques of IOT edge computing to provide meaningful intuitive results to users. The paper envisions two modules of building a real time data analytics system. In the first module, we propose to maintain confidentiality and integrity of IoT data, which is of paramount importance, and manage large-scale data analytics with real-time data collection from various IoT devices in parallel. We envision a framework to preserve data privacy utilizing Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) such as Intel SGX, end-to-end data encryption mechanism, and strong access control policies. Moreover, we design a generic framework to simplify the process of collecting and storing heterogeneous data coming from diverse IoT devices.

In this paper we introduce KryptoOracle, a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation.

In this paper, we present a novel machine-learning model, solving a binary classification problem, that can predict transaction fee volatility in the Bitcoin network so that users can optimize their fees expenses and the approval time for their transactions.

New features that we generate include information on how many bytes were already occupied by other transactions in the mempool, assuming they are ordered by fee density in each mining pool.

In this work, we present concretely-eficient protocols for secure 3-party computation (3PC) over a ring of integers modulo 2 tolerating one corruption, both with semi-honest and malicious security. Owing to the fact that computation over ring emulates computation over the real-world system architectures, secure computation over ring has gained momentum of late. Cast in the offline-online paradigm, our constructions present the most eficient online phase in concrete terms. In the semi-honest setting, our protocol requires communication of 2 ring elements per multiplication gate during the online phase. In the malicious setting, our protocol requires communication of 4 elements per multiplication gate during the online phase, beating the state-of-the-art protocol by 5 elements. Realized with both the security notions of selective abort and fairness, the malicious protocol with fairness involves a slightly more communication than its counterpart with abort security for the output gates alone. We apply our techniques from 3PC in the regime of secure server-aided machine-learning (ML) inference for a range of prediction functions-linear regression, linear SVM regression, logistic regression, and linear SVM classification. Our setting considers a model-owner with trained model parameters and a client with a query, with the latter willing to learn the prediction of her query based on the model parameters of the former. The inputs and computation are outsourced to a set of three non-colluding servers. Our constructions catering to both semi-honest and malicious world, invariably perform better than the existing constructions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076111538

However, the spread of ML technologies allows an attacker to use them into the attack for the sake of sniffing secret information. Since the randomness has been used for an inseparable part of the cryptographic applications to ensure the security, the resistance of a random sequence against analysis based on the ML technologies have to be required. The authors anticipate having the mutual relationship between the classical properties of the randomness, linear complexity (LC) in particular, and the structure of a neural network (NN), which is a class of ML. In this research, the authors find that the strength of each connection between nodes in the NN is relevant to the linear recurrence relation of the target sequence by observing parameters after complete learning. In other words, the difficulty of predicting the next bits from a given sequence would be discussed based on the LC of a sequence in most cases.

This study shows Recurrent Neural Network Learning Model on the basis of LSTM, which analyzes the previous prices of a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and predicts the next one. Methods/Statistical analysis: This model indicates the actual and predicted prices of Bitcoin for 81 days in the way that it has learned the former prices for 30 days and then anticipates the next day price. Regularized data set for Modeling is divided into test data set and training data set at the rate of 1:9. The latter set is once again separated into training data and verification ones. Machine Learning of this study needs to use Neural Network library, Keras framework. Findings: To fit the model is to look for the model’s weight by optimizing the process, while using the training data. In this paper, fit function’s batch size is 11 and epochs is 30. As learning gets processed more repetitively, the loss decreases more monotonously, and then it converges to more regular value. That is, it means there is no overfitting. Improvements/Applications: As the result of the experiment, the machine learning proposes not only that after analyzing the graphs of error rates and weight change rates, weight converges towards a particular one, but also that as learning goes over, the processing efficiency of its neural network gets better. © 2019 SERSC.","Bitcoin; Block Chain; LSTM; Prediction; Price; Recurrent Neural Network",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080129860

Content related information that can be used in such strategies include information about the video frame type (Intra-Predicted, Inter-Predicted or Backward-Predicted). Frame type identification and prediction in the MAC layer scheduler (as well as in other network locations) is hence a critical part of content-aware resource management and traffic engineering in video streaming. It is important to note that, when encryption is adopted at the upper layers, packet inspection is not possible. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive clustering and prediction algorithm. The algorithm uses unsupervised clustering combined with an adaptive classification approach to automatically group packets into frame clusters. Unlike conventional video traffic classifiers, our approach requires neither a-priori knowledge of video frames pattern nor a training set of frames. Instead, this approach automatically classifies packets into different frame types by employing simple statistical features. The proposed method continuously learns from the upcoming traffic thus the proper frame class labels can be easily discovered. Furthermore, the proposed method uses an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm to predict the upcoming traffic frame type. A large number of experiments has been carried out using data from several video samples. Results show the robustness and the effectiveness of our classification method, which is capable of achieving a detection rate of up to 97.3% for I frames and overall 2 identification accuracy of 91.3% (for all I, P and B frames). © 2019 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073795554

We discuss the blockchain integration for games and then categorize existing blockchain games from the aspects of their genres and technical platforms. Moreover, by analyzing the industrial trend with a statistical approach, we envision the future of blockchain games from technological and commercial perspectives. © 2019 IEEE.","Application; Blockchain; Decentralization; Game; Software; Survey",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072397952

While a few studies employ conventional statistical and econometric approaches to reveal the driving factors of Bitcoin's prices, research on the development of forecasting models to be used as decision support tools in investment strategies is scarce. This study proposes a computational intelligence technique that uses a hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy controller, namely PATSOS, to forecast the direction in the change of the daily price of Bitcoin. The proposed methodology outperforms two other computational intelligence models, the first being developed with a simpler neuro-fuzzy approach, and the second being developed with artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the investment returns achieved by a trading simulation, based on the signals of the proposed model, are 71.21% higher than the ones achieved through a naive buy-and-hold strategy. The performance of the PATSOS system is robust to the use of other cryptocurrencies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Bitcoin price forecasting; Fuzzy sets; Neuro-fuzzy forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060541201

In this paper, we propose a system for predicting home ownership using machine learning, i.e. whether the user is likely to be a homeowner or a renter, on the basis of the user's demographic data, in a way that preserves the user's privacy while making the predictions. Our system uses differential private data perturbation along with homomorphic encryption of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors as the privacy preservation technique to mask the real identities of the users whose home ownership data is predicted. Our trained model is used for prediction on a sample dataset of a few thousand users. We get an accuracy of 69% in the prediction, which is around 4% lower than the algorithm performance without the privacy preservation. This shows that it is feasible to implement privacy preservation techniques on demographic prediction without compromising on the prediction accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.","differential privacy; home ownership; homomorphic encryption; privacy preservation; user profile",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081991584

Our C2P2 algorithm is the first algorithm to consider the fact that the price of a cryptocurrency c might depend not only on historical prices, sentiments, global stock indices, but also on the prices and predicted prices of other cryptocurrencies. C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time - rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16%. In both cases, C2P2 is the winner on all cryptocurrencies considered. Moreover, we experimentally show that the use of similarity metrics within our C2P2 algorithm leads to a direct improvement for 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies ranging from 0.4% to 17.8%.

The results of our study revealed that while the ratios of posts on BCS development are increasing, the ratios of posts on mining cryptocurrencies are decreasing. Due to the scarcity of expert blockchain developers, posts on BCS development are more likely to go either answered or encounter more delays than posts on other topics.

Similarly, Cryptocurrency is a new extension of digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. In the current digital exchanging world, investors and interested parties are eager to know more information about, and the capabilites of, this new type of currency. One of the potential paths to retrieve the info automatically and quickly is through a chatbot. We explored the open source python library, Chatterbot, to apply Itchat API (a WeChat interface) with the aim of building a robot chatting application, IC Chat, on the topic of cryptocurrency. First, we collected question and answer pairs datasets from Quora websites. Furthermore, we also created API calls to query the real time quote for the top 25 cryptocurrencies. Then we used the collected data to train our chatbot and implemented a logic adapter to receive the price quote of cryptocurrencies based on the incoming question. The Itchat API method will return the best matched answer to the asking party automatically. The response time of different questions has been investigated.

The market microstructure for bitcoins is highly developed in terms of information generation and transfer. Therefore, returns volatility is highly likely to be affected by market information availability. We analyze the relationship between returns volatility and two independent variables, user opinion difference and user interest. This study adopted the GJR-GARCH model, appropriate for volatility studies. First, we find that, for volatility asymmetry, the Bitcoin market exhibits greater market efficiency than the general financial market. Also, the persistence of volatility is greater. The Bitcoin market is still relatively unregulated; hence, studying the relationship between information asymmetry and regulation in the market is salient. Moreover, we can infer that the ratio of reasonable users is high in the Bitcoin market. Second, the Bitcoin market supports the sequential information arrival hypothesis in that day trading volume, which is a proxy for user differences of opinion, has a statistically significant effect on returns volatility. Third, for the proxies of user interest, namely, the growth rate of page views on Google Trends and Wikipedia, only the growth rate of Google Trends shows statistically significant effects on Bitcoin returns volatility. This study can provide useful information to the financial market and policy makers on the behavior of the Bitcoin market, which may help to lower future entry barriers and opportunity costs of the Bitcoin market. © 2018","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; GJR-GARCH; Market efficiency; Trading volume; User differences of opinion; User interest; Volatility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059664989

Constant memory features are extracted from the encrypted network traffic in these three windows in a stream-based fashion, and fed into a random forest model, which predicts whether the current time slot contains stalling or not. The presented system can predict stalling with a very high accuracy and the finest granularity to date (1s), and thus, can be used in networks for real-time QoE analysis from encrypted YouTube video streaming traffic. The independent predictions for each consecutive slot of a streaming session can further be aggregated to obtain stalling estimations for the whole session.

In this paper, we address the problem of real-time QoE monitoring of HAS, focusing on the detection of re-buffering events and QoE-relevant metrics, for the particular case of YouTube. Given the wide adoption of end-to-end encryption, we resort to machine learning models to predict these metrics directly from the analysis of the encrypted traffic. The salient feature of our approach ViCrypt is its ability to perform QoE predictions in real-time, during the course of an ongoing YouTube streaming session, relying on constant memory, stream-like inputs continuously extracted from the encrypted stream of packets. We show through empirical evaluations that ViCrypt can predict the occurrence of re-buffering events with a time granularity as small as one second with very high accuracy. By aggregating independent predictions, ViCrypt is able to accurately estimate per-video-session QoE-relevant metrics such as initial playback delay, number of re-buffering events and stalling ratio. In this situation, we investigate if a decent prediction performance can also be reached by selecting reduced feature sets based on the relevance of the features.

While turbidity itself does not directly present a hazard to human health, it can be an indication of poor water quality and mask the presence of parasites such as Cryptosporidium. It is, therefore, a recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) that turbidity should not exceed a level of 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) before chlorination. For a drinking water supplier, turbidity peaks can be highly disruptive requiring the temporary shutdown of a water treatment works. Such events must be carefully managed to ensure continued supply; to recover the supply deficit, water stores must be depleted or alternative works utilised. Machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective for the modelling of complex environmental systems, often used to help shape environmental policy. We contribute to the literature by adopting such techniques for operational purposes, developing a decision support tool that predicts >1 NTU turbidity events up to seven days in advance allowing water supply managers to make proactive interventions. We apply a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and a Random Forest (RF) model for the prediction of >1 NTU events. AUROC scores of over 0.80 at five of six sites suggest that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting turbidity peaking events. Furthermore, we find that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost due to its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics; Turbidity prediction; Water quality",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062642158

However, the challenge in predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate is its high volatility. Therefore, the prediction of its behavior is of great importance for financial markets. In this way, recent studies have been carried out on what internal and/or external Bitcoin information is relevant to its prediction. The increased use of machine learning techniques to predict time series and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments motivated the present study to seek more accurate predictions for the Bitcoin exchange rate. In this way, in a first stage of the proposed methodology, different feature selection techniques were evaluated in order to obtain the most relevant attributes for the predictions. In the sequence, it was analyzed the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble algorithms (based on Recurrent Neural Networks and the k-Means clustering method) for price direction predictions. Likewise, the ANN and SVM were employed for regression of the maximum, minimum and closing prices of the Bitcoin. Moreover, the regression results were also used as inputs to try to improve the price direction predictions. The results showed that the selected attributes and the best machine learning model achieved an improvement of more than 10%, in accuracy, for the price direction predictions, with respect to the state-of-the-art papers, using the same period of information. In relation to the maximum, minimum and closing Bitcoin prices regressions, it was possible to obtain Mean Absolute Percentage Errors between 1% and 2%.

On the Bitcoin Blockchain, an owning entity’s real-world identity is hidden behind a pseudonym, a so-called address. Therefore, Bitcoin is widely assumed to provide a high degree of anonymity, which is a driver for its frequent use for illicit activities. This paper presents a novel approach for de-anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilized a sample of 957 entities (with ≈385 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 12 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm with default parameters, we achieve a mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.42% and F1-score of ≈79.64%. We show two examples, one where we predict on a set of 22 clusters that are suspected to be related to cybercriminal activities, and another where we classify 153,293 clusters to provide an estimation of the activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

It has many applications in various areas such as finance, education, genomics, and medical field that have sensitive private data. While several studies have been reported on the prediction phase, few studies have been conducted on the training phase.

In this work, we introduce and explore a new problem called the model-oblivious problem, where a trainer can delegate a protected model to a resource provider without revealing the original model itself to the resource provider. The resource provider can then offer prediction on a client's input data, which is additionally kept private from the resource provider. To solve this problem, we present MOBIUS (Model-Oblivious BInary neUral networkS), a new system that combines Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) and secure computation based on secret sharing as tools for scalable and fast privacy-preserving machine learning. BNNs improve computational performance by binarizing values in training to-1 and +1, while secure computation based on secret sharing provides fast and various computations under encrypted forms via modulo operations with a short bit length. However, combining these tools is not trivial because their operations have different algebraic structures. MOBIUS uses improved procedures of BNNs and secure computation that have compatible algebraic structures without downgrading prediction accuracy. We present an implementation of MOBIUS in C++ using the ABY library (NDSS 2015). Then, we conduct experiments using several datasets, including the MNIST, Cancer, and Diabetes datasets, and the results show that MOBIUS outperforms SecureML (IEEE S&P 2017), which is the only other work that can potentially tackle the model-oblivious problem, in terms of both accuracy and computational time.

The time series composed of the BTC / USD currency pair data is analysed; the period analysed is a day. The authors analysed the neural network architecture, built a neural network model taking into account the heterogeneity and random volatility of the time series, developed and implemented an algorithm for solving the problem in the Python system. For training the neural network, data were used for the period from September 24, 2013, to March 17, 2019 (a total of 2002 data sets). The experiment boils down to that the constructed neural network model is trying to determine the trend of the time series for one next timeframe. The training was conducted with a ""teacher"".

However, it has been widely reported that it can be used for investment scams, which are referred to as high yield investment programs (HYIP). Although from the security forensic point of view it is very important to identify the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, so far in the open technical literature no systematic method which reliably collects and identifies such Bitcoin addresses has been proposed. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced, which efficiently collects a large number of the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses and identifies them based upon a novel analysis of their transactions history. In particular, a scraping-based method is first proposed which is able to collect more than 2,000 HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses from the Internet thus providing a large number of the HYIPs' samples. Second, a supervised machine learning technique, which classifies, whether or not, specific Bitcoin addresses belong to the HYIP operators, is introduced and its performance is evaluated. The proposed classification method is based upon two novel approaches, namely the rate conversion technique that mitigates the effect of Bitcoin price volatility and the sampling technique that reduces the computational amount without sacrificing the classification performance. By employing close to 30,000 real Bitcoin addresses, extensive performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulation experiments have shown that the proposed methodology achieves excellent performance, i.e., 95% of the HYIP addresses can be correctly classified, while maintaining a false positive rate less than 4.9%. In order to further validate the proposed classifier's ability to detect the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, our designed classifier has been tested against a recently published list of the HYIP addresses maintaining its excellent detection accuracy by achieving a 93.75% success rate. © 2013 IEEE.","Bitcoin; blockchain analysis; data mining; forensics; HYIP (high yield investment programs)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068341241

This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The other cryptocurrencies are not included in the study because of having insufficient relevant data on the social forums. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Apart from that, the public perception and environment feasibility are also determined. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden shows positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment. Which ranks the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the significant terms are also determined using Topic modeling from public opinions. Such as authorization rules, investment, profit, volatility, and security etc. These terms are almost identified as subtopic for each of the inquired keyword.

In the near future, biometrics systems will be everywhere in the society, such as government, education, smart cities, banks etc. Due to its uniqueness, characteristic, biometrics systems will become more and more vulnerable, privacy being one of the most important challenges. The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell. The wide range of technologies for developing the algorithms give the readers the possibility and not only, to choose the proper modules for their own research or business direction. The cryptographic modules contain algorithms based on machine learning and modern cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption System), SHA-256, RC4, RC5, RC6, MARS, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), Elliptic Curve, and Diffie Hellman. As methods for implementing with success the cryptographic modules, we will propose a methodology which can be used as a how-to guide. The article will focus only on the first category, machine learning, and data clustering, algorithms with applicability in the cloud computing environment. For tests we have used a virtual machine (Virtual Box) with Apache Hadoop and a Biometric Analysis Tool. The weakness of the algorithms and methods implemented within the framework will be evaluated and presented in order for the reader to acknowledge the latest status of the security analysis and the vulnerabilities founded in the mentioned algorithms. Another important result of the authors consists in creating a scheme for biometric enrollment (in Results). The purpose of the scheme is to give a big overview on how to use it, step by step, in real life, and how to use the algorithms. In the end, as a conclusion, the current work paper gives a comprehensive background on the most important and challenging aspects on how to design and implement an authentication system based on biometrics characteristics. © 2018 by the authors.

The contractual continuous Cloud security research is as well fuelled by the abrupt popping up of attacks that even extend to silent or stealth. Moreover these silent or stealth attacks are characterised by low observability along with bad traceability resulting in their difficulty detection, traceability and prevention. Due to the nature of silent or stealth attacks that have difficulty detection, traceability and prevention calibre, it means traditional and/or ordinary security mechanisms won't be sufficient to compact such attacks.

One of the major types of malware, ransomware, encrypts a user’s sensitive information and only returns the original files to the user after a ransom is paid. As malware developers shift the delivery of their product from HTTP to HTTPS to protect themselves from payload inspection, we can no longer rely on deep packet inspection to extract features for malware identification. Toward this goal, we propose a solution leveraging a recent trend in networking hardware, that is programmable forwarding engines (PFEs). PFEs allow collection of per-packet, network monitoring data at high rates. We use this data to monitor the network traffic between an infected computer and the command and control (C&C) server. We extract high-level flow features from this traffic and use this data for ransomware classification. We write a stream processor and use a random forest, binary classifier to utilizes these rich flow records in fingerprinting malicious, network activity without the requirement of deep packet inspection. Our classification model achieves a detection rate in excess of 0.86, while maintaining a false negative rate under 0.11.

This study aims to investigate how the Korean government has developed and implemented regulatory policies. Methods/Statistical analysis: This study draws on documentary research. Various documents were used, mainly including government publications, research papers, and trend analysis reports. Documentary research was an appropriate method in this research. F irstly, there has not been enough attention to this research topic, which needed to acquire contextualized knowledge before carrying out empirical research. Secondly, performing empirical research was not feasible at the time of this research due to fast-changing technical elements. Findings: To effectively control misuse of cryptocurrencies, the Korean government has developed and enforced regulatory policies . The government policies were manifestations of an interdepartmental approach initiated by the higher government. However, those regulatory policies were not based upon any comprehensive regulatory framework tailored to cryptocurrencies. Also, two strands of regulatory strategies were adopted. The first strategy focused on regulating cryptocurrency exchanges. T hose exchanges were found to be the least regulated by the government unlike comparable financial exchanges. This approach could be effective in that individual users were required to use traditional banking services when buying and selling cryptocurrencies. The second strategy depended on the pre-existing financial regulatory framework by utilizing public financial institutions. This traditional regulatory framework included watchdog agencies, banks, and credit card companies. The financial regulatory framework also set the b oundary for relevant policies of nonfinancial institutions. In this respect, non-financial institutions involved did not have a clear presence in the framework, while public financial institutions' role was extensive enough to put pressure on cryptocurren cy exchanges. Improvements/Applications: The governmental approach to cryptocurrencies needs to be revamped over time because the contextual factors change constantly. It needs to incorporate government's responses as well as market trends. © 2018 Authors.","Cryptocurrency; Financial institutions; Financial regulatory framework; Non-financial institutions; Regulatory policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082344909

Prediction as a service is a paradigm in which service providers with technological expertise and computational resources may perform predictions for clients. However, data privacy severely restricts the applicability of such services, unless measures to keep client data private (even from the service provider) are designed. Equally important is to minimize the amount of computation and communication required between client and server. Fully homomprphic encryption offers a possible way out, whereby clients may encrypt their data, and on which the server may perform arithmetic computations. The main drawback of using fully homomorphic encryption is the amount of time required to evaluate large machine learning models on encrypted data.

By applying the leveled homomorphic encryption scheme, CryptoNets enables the cloud server to securely run the computation process without participations of other parties. Since the encryption scheme only supports polynomial operations, the authors simply use square activation as a substitution of the conventional activations, obtaining a relatively low prediction accuracy on the MNIST dataset (98.95%). Later work try to improve the accuracy by using polynomial approximations of the ReLU activation with large neural networks, which introduce heavy computation cost, making the prediction process impractical. In this paper, to achieve better prediction performance, we propose new parametric polynomial (PPoly) activations, which can adaptively learn the parameters during the training phase. Using our PPoly activations, we achieve higher accuracy (99.33%, 99.64%, and 99.70%) with shallow and narrow networks, guaranteeing the efficiency of prediction process. We conduct extensive experiments to show the expressiveness of our PPoly activations and discuss the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency for the prediction on encrypted data. © 2013 IEEE.","leveled homomorphic encryption; neural network; Polynomial activation; prediction",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057201880

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol. Last, we discuss current existing security studies and solutions and summarize open research challenges and trends for future research in Bitcoin security. © 2013 IEEE.","anomaly detection; Bitcoin; blockchain; machine learning (ML); security",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056555599

Investors are continually seeking new ways to extract meaningful information about the future direction of price changes. Recently, cryptocurrencies have attracted huge attention due to their unique way of transferring value as well as its value as a hedge. A method proposed in this project involves using data mining techniques: mining text documents such as news articles and tweets try to infer the relationship between information contained in such items and cryptocurrency price direction. The Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) assists in creating a hybrid model which comprises of sentiment analysis techniques, as well as a predictive machine learning model. The success of the model was evaluated within the context of predicting the direction of Bitcoin price changes. Findings reported here reveal that our system yields more accurate and real-time predictions of Bitcoin price fluctuations when compared to other existing models in the market.

There are a number of existing ways by which botnet can be detected. A comprehensive overview of the existing techniques is also stated in this paper. Due to the involvement of huge amount of data, detection of botnet using machine learning algorithms is in huge trend. In this paper, we have used machine learning to train classifiers by a specific network flow dataset. Thereafter, the trained classifiers were applied on the collected data in order to evaluate the results. Analysis of network flow data is usedas a method of detection because it doesn't depend upon the packet content hence giving immunity towards the latest form of encryption and obfuscation used by attackers in order to hide their bots. Results are clearly showing that the proposed method is capable of differentiating the normal traffic and the bot traffic with a high accuracy and low false positive rate. In addition to this, almost every type of botnet can be detected using the proposed model. © 2018 The Authors.
