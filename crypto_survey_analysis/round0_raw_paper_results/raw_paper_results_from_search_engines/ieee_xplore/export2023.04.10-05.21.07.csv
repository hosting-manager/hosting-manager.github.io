But people are still hesitant to use this technology because of the high price volatility are variable markets. The majority of the forecasting solutions reported have some level of error and cannot predict the price accurately due to randomness. The proposed model consists of using parent coins as a parameter for price prediction to overcome market volatility. Moving average is used as a data preprocessing technique for the effective prediction of Litecoin and Dogecoin prices. Also, in this, we are using Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra- Tree-Regressor and Ridge regressor models for predicting the close price of cryptocurrencies.

With the enhancement of machine learning algorithms and increased computational capabilities, machine learning has proved one of the most efficient cryptocurrency prediction methods. However, most studies focused on single digital currency prediction or small-scale algorithm comparison for multiple currencies. This study aims to present a comparative performance of large-scale selected Machine Learning algorithms for cryptocurrency forecasting. Specifically, this paper concentrates on forecasting time series data for a short-term trading period in ten cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, XRP, DOGE, LUNA, LINK, LTC, and BCH) with ten selected machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Bayesian Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine). Our experiment results show that the Gradient Boosting with the mean square error criterion is superior in predicting most major cryptocurrencies by performing statistical analysis and data visualizations. Additionally, the Random Forest and Decision Tree model built by the Classification and Regression Tree algorithm also shows outstanding performance in certain currencies such as ETH, XRP, LUNA, and LTC. Thus, all three algorithms can help anticipate the short-term evolutions of the cryptocurrency market.","","978-1-6654-8290-5","10.1109/CACML55074.2022.00054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852573","machine learning;forecasting;supervised learning;cryptocurrency","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Time series analysis;Prediction algorithms;Boosting;Cryptocurrency;Classification algorithms","Bayes methods;cryptocurrencies;data visualisation;decision trees;economic forecasting;financial data processing;gradient methods;mean square error methods;nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;pricing;random forests;regression analysis;support vector machines;time series","cryptocurrency price forecasting;cryptocurrency market;cryptocurrency price predictions;computational capabilities;efficient cryptocurrency prediction methods;single digital currency prediction;multiple currencies;cryptocurrency forecasting;time series data forecasting;short-term trading period;Linear Regression;Ridge Regression;Lasso Regression;Bayesian Regression;Random Forest;Gradient Boosting;Support Vector Machine;statistical analysis;data visualizations;Decision Tree model;short-term evolutions;large-scale selected machine learning algorithms;BTC;ETH;ADA;BNB;XRP;DOGE;LUNA;LINK;LTC;BCH","","1","","22","IEEE","19 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This exponential growth relies mostly on the extreme volatility of the market, which led many people to become interested and get involved, primarily for profit. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts tend to share and learn news and opinions on social media platforms, one of the most popular being Twitter. In this paper, we study the extent to which Twitter sentiment analysis can be used to predict price fluctuations for cryptocurrencies. Initially, we gathered tweets and price data of seven of the most popular cryptocurrencies, which were processed to perform sentiment analysis using Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER). The time-series stationarity was determined with Augmented Dicky Fuller (ADF) Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin (KPSS) tests and then Granger Causality testing took place. While price fluctuations seem to cause sentiment for Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP and Doge, predictability was found for Ethereum and Polkadot, based on a bullishness ratio. Finally, predictability of price returns is examined with Vector Autoregression (VAR) and highly accurate forecasts for two of the seven cryptocurrencies were achieved. More specifically, price forecasts of Ethereum’s and Polkadot’s prices reached 99.67% and 99.17% accuracy, respectively.","","978-1-6654-6390-4","10.1109/IISA56318.2022.9904351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9904351","Cryptocurrency;Forecasting;Prediction;Sentiment Analysis;Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER);Augmented Dicky Fuller (ADF);Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin (KPSS);Granger Causality test;Vector Autoregression (VAR);Bullishness","Sentiment analysis;Reactive power;Fluctuations;Dictionaries;Social networking (online);Blogs;Bitcoin","autoregressive processes;cryptocurrencies;economic forecasting;financial data processing;sentiment analysis;share prices;social networking (online);stock markets;time series","cryptocurrency price prediction;social media sentiment analysis;Bitcoin;Twitter sentiment analysis;price fluctuation prediction;price data;time-series stationarity;Granger Causality testing;Polkadot;Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym;tweet data;price forecasting;Ethereum;price return predictability;augmented Dicky Fuller-Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin tests;valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning;ADF-KPSS tests;Cardano;XRP;Doge;vector autoregression;market volatility","","1","","33","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We used sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques to extract tweets from Twitter postings to examine the relationship between bitcoin price changes and tweet sentiment. We used a variety of machine learning methods to create a prediction model and insightful analysis of future market values. We use five distinct machine learning models, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Prophet, An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and XGBoost. Every model was tested on the last 30% of the data after training on the first 70%. The models' Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) are compared. The expansion of the collection of significant characteristics retrieved from textual data using sentiment analysis employing long short-term memory is another way that this work adds to the body of knowledge on directed bitcoin price returns forecast (LSTM).

This has led to the creation of numerous brands of cryptocurrencies. It was only after the boom in their price in 2011 that they began to be regarded as an investment asset. Since these coins are highly volatile in their pricing, there is a need for a good prediction of their closing price on which investment decisions can be made. To address this requirement, this paper studies the relative performances of different machine learning algorithms for a well-known cryptocurrency - the ‘Bitcoin’. The performance measures of different machine learning models were undertaken to get the accuracy of the models for Bitcoin and results were obtained. The results show that the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is better than the other models and has the least mean absolute error. It is observed that the quality of training data and amount of the dataset used plays an important role for a successful prediction.

The computational hardness is the fundamental basis of the security of these keys. However, in the era of quantum computing, quantum computers can break down these keys with their substantially more computation capability than normal computers. For instance, a quantum computer can easily break down RSA or ECC in polynomial time. In order to make the keys quantum resistant, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is developed to enforce security of the classical cryptographic keys from the attack of quantum computers. By using quantum mechanics, QKD can reinforce the durability of the keys of classical cryptography, which were practically unbreakable during the pre-quantum era. Thus, an extensive study is required to understand the importance of QKD to make the classical cryptographic key distributions secure against both classical and quantum computers. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss trends and limitations of key management protocols in classical cryptography, and demonstrates a relative study of different QKD protocols. In addition, we highlight the security implementation aspects of QKD, which lead to the solution of threats occurring in a quantum computing scenario, such that the cryptographic keys can be quantum resistant.","","978-1-7281-8595-8","10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579624","Key distribution;Classical cryptography;Quantum cryptography;QKD;Quantum computing","Computers;Resistance;Technological innovation;Quantum computing;Protocols;Market research;Hardware","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;quantum computing;quantum cryptography","quantum computer;Quantum Key Distribution;QKD protocols;classical cryptographic keys;quantum mechanics;classical cryptography;pre-quantum era;classical cryptographic key distributions;key management protocols;quantum computing scenario;Quantum resistance;computational hardness;computation capability;RSA;QKD;elliptic curve cryptography;Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptography","","","","63","IEEE","3 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation. Further, to check the usability of DL-GuesS on other cryptocurrencies, we have also inferred results for price prediction of Bitcoin-Cash with the price history and tweets of Bitcoin-Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3163305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745117","Cryptocurrency;complex systems;fusion of cryptocurrency;price prediction;VADER;sentiment analysis;deep learning;systems of systems","Cryptography;Predictive models;Bitcoin;Hidden Markov models;Deep learning;Data models;Social networking (online)","cryptography;financial data processing;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);pricing;social networking (online);stock markets;transaction processing","sentiment analysis-based cryptocurrency price prediction;market sentiment-based models;price history","","3","","31","CCBY","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to IoT devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like IoT applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term IoT device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat. This article provides a survey on what can be called post-quantum IoT systems (IoT systems protected from the currently known quantum computing attacks): the main post-quantum cryptosystems and initiatives are reviewed, the most relevant IoT architectures and challenges are analyzed, and the expected future trends are indicated.

The results show that our hybrid model has a similar predictive performance in terms of MSE, MAE and RMSE but higher metric scores in precision, accuracy and F1 score under optimal hyperparameters. This study reveals that the combination of parametric models like GARCH with deep neural network may come up with better results in cryptocurrency price forecasting especially in the case of highly volatile data or when short data sequences are available.

For proof of concept, the authors experimentally evaluated both of the proposed QTTPs (Standard QTTP and QTTP with Huffman Coding) using Quantum Information Science Kit (Qiskit), a quantum computing platform and simulated on IBM QASM Simulator and on IBM real quantum hardware.","","978-1-6654-5361-5","10.1109/TQCEBT54229.2022.10041500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041500","Huffman Coding;No-Cloning Theorem;Quantum Computing;Quantum Gates;Quantum Information Science Kit;Quantum Teleportation","Quantum computing;Protocols;Teleportation;Quantum state;Quantum information science;Market research;Hardware","cryptography;data compression;Huffman codes;quantum computing;quantum entanglement;teleportation","entire text;Huffman Coding approach;IBM real quantum hardware;prefix codes;QTTP;quantum computing platform;Quantum Information Science Kit;quantum states;Quantum Teleportation technique;Quantum Text Teleportation Protocol;secure Text transfer;secure text transfers","","","","26","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It made Bitcoin a very profitable market for investment but Bitcoin saw many ups and down as well. Today’s Bitcoin price is 3913 USD but that doesn’t mean that the prices always keep falling. The price of Bitcoin vary over time and is governed by various factors, like the market it is being traded in, scarcity, supply and demand. What has made Bitcoin valuable is that it can be used as a currency, we can pay a part or a fraction of Bitcoin to a person in exchange for something and the part is easily verifiable by blockchain. The small number of Bitcoin, roughly 16 million Bitcoins for the entire world has made it scare and above that its high utility makes it more prestigious.Trading of Bitcoin has proved to be very profitable to many people but the risk in trading is huge as the market of Bitcoin is very volatile. To decrease the risks, this project has been carried out to predict the price of Bitcoin using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Linear Regression(LR) to predict the price of Bitcoin. Evaluation of these algorithms is carried out to determine which among the two is better for the prediction of Bitcoin prices. The dataset used contains minute by minute prices of Bitcoin of over 5 years and contains almost 30,00,000 entries. Since, the dataset used is a big data, evaluating the performance of algorithms over a large dataset will give accurate results.","","978-1-7281-2813-9","10.1109/ICISC47916.2020.9171147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171147","Bitcoin;cryptocurrency;Recurrent neural network;Long short term memory;Linear regression","Training;Recurrent neural networks;Machine learning algorithms;Supply and demand;Computational modeling;Linear regression;Bitcoin","Big Data;cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);pricing;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis","bitcoin price prediction;machine learning algorithms;performance evaluation;cryptocurrency;United States Dollar;investment;profitable market;blockchain;recurrent neural network;RNN;long short term memory;LSTM;linear regression;Big Data","","5","1","13","IEEE","19 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, because this financial sector is already known for its extreme volatility and quick price changes, over brief periods of time. For such constantly changing nature of crypto trends and price, it has become a necessary part for traders and crypto enthusiast to get a detailed analysis before investing. Also, the construction of a precise and dependable forecasting model is regarded vital for portfolio management and optimization. In this paper we propose a web system, which will help to understand cryptocurrency in a more statistical way. Proposed system focuses mainly on four coins : Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu performing analysis and forecasting on all the four coins. System will also do statistical comparison between the coins. Analysis and comparison is carried out using python libraries and modules whereas LSTM and ARIMA are used for forecasting. Extensive research was conducted using real-time and historical information, on four key cryptocurrencies, two of which had the greatest market capitalization, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, while the other, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, that had a significant growth in market capitalization over the previous year. In comparison to old fully-connected deep neural networks, the suggested model may employ mixed crypto data more proficiently, minimizing overfitting and computing costs.","","978-1-6654-6851-0","10.1109/ASIANCON55314.2022.9909168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9909168","LSTM(Long short-term memory);ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average);Real time data;historical data;BTC;ETH;Dogecoin;Shiba;prediction;analysis","Technological innovation;Neural networks;Bitcoin;Predictive models;Market research;Real-time systems;Libraries","autoregressive moving average processes;cryptocurrencies;economic forecasting;financial data processing;forecasting theory;investment;optimisation;pricing;recurrent neural nets","ARIMA;Bitcoin;crypto price;crypto trends;cryptocurrency forecasting;cryptocurrency analysis;cryptocurrency trading;Dogecoin;Ethereum;forecasting model;historical information;LSTM;lucrative investments;mixed crypto data;monetary businesses;portfolio management;Python libraries;real-time information;Shiba Inu;Web system","","","","23","IEEE","11 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crypto is the buzzword nowadays where people worldwide are investing their money in a digital payment transaction and have ticked all the boxes when it comes to cases such as security, seemingly fast transactions, and has quickly emerged as one the world's fastest-growing financial markets. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency launched in 2009 showcased the proof of work of a decentralised system and what blockchain is capable of doing in a digital ecosystem. Scope: Our paper aims at suggesting currencies to future investors based on the sentiments on popular social media and predicting the overall growth of any coin to analyze its growth prospects. Method: In this paper, we have attempted a meticulous approach to predict the price movements in cryptocurrencies considering its fluctuating factors. Since no unique model can predict the market changes effectively, we focussed on creating a SETP (Sentiment Evaluation for Trend Prediction) model, which analyzes the sentiment surrounding the crypto market and the apprehensions that engulf an investor while investing. The statistical data analysis of the top 5 coins in the market has been undertaken effectively using IBM Watson services. Further enhancements have been made using the jupyter notebook to predict the market highs of the top trending coins. The sentimental evaluation has been done by extracting Twitter trends and hashtags thereby judging the sentiments of the microblogging site and paving a way to predict the exact emotion of investors all over the globe. Findings: Finally, we believe that this research has immense capability to predict the market speculation using the various technologies that are still in the rudimentary phase and has a lot of potential in invoking the interest of researchers and providing useful data/cognizance for future investors.","","978-1-6654-3811-7","10.1109/ICAC3N53548.2021.9725704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9725704","Data Analysis;Sentiments;Prediction;Cryptocurrency;Machine Learning","Analytical models;Social networking (online);Mood;Blogs;Predictive models;Market research;Proof of Work","cryptocurrencies;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","digital payment transaction;financial markets;bitcoin;cryptocurrency;decentralised system;blockchain;digital ecosystem;social media;coin;price movements;fluctuating factors;unique model;market changes;Sentiment Evaluation for Trend Prediction;crypto market;statistical data analysis;IBM Watson services;trending coins;Twitter trends;market speculation;crypto currency portfolio allocation;machine learning;economic health patterns change;wealth preservation;buzzword;sentiment evaluation for trend prediction model;SETP","","","","12","IEEE","9 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation.

Forecasting the Bitcoin price as accurate as possible is essential, but due to its high volatility this task is challenging. Many researchers try, through the years, to develop efficient models for predicting the Bitcoin price using several different data-driven approaches. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel decomposition-ensemble learning model that combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) with machine learning algorithms to forecast the Bitcoin price multi-step ahead. The algorithms are k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel, Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with single-layer perceptron, Generalized Linear Model, and Cubist. Correlation matrix (CORR), principal component analysis (PCA), and Box-Cox transformation (BOXCOX) were used as data preprocessing techniques. Estimating the performance of the proposed models (namely VMD-STACK-CORR, VMD-STACK-PCA, and VMD-STACK-BOXCOX) using relative root mean square error, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and absolute percentage error measures, defined that for one-day-ahead forecast VMD-STAK-BOXCOX model presented the better performance, and for two and three-days-ahead forecast VMD-STACK-CORR model was chosen, compared to VMD, STACK, and machine learning algorithms models' performance. Diebold-Mariano statistical test was conducted to evaluate a reduction in forecasting errors. Therefore, the proposed models (VMD-STACK-CORR, VMD-STACK-PCA, and VMD-STACK-BOXCOX) indeed forecast accurately Bitcoin price and outperformed the compared models (VMD, STACK, and machine learning models).","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207152","Bitcoin price;variational mode decomposition;stacking-ensemble learning;forecasting;time series","Predictive models;Biological system modeling;Data models;Bitcoin;Training;Machine learning algorithms","economic forecasting;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;multilayer perceptrons;pricing;principal component analysis;regression analysis;support vector machines","cryptocurrency market;decomposition-ensemble learning model;variational mode decomposition;stacking-ensemble learning;support vector regression;feed-forward artificial neural network;generalized linear model;principal component analysis;VMD-STACK-PCA;relative root mean square error;symmetric mean absolute percentage error;absolute percentage error measures;one-day-ahead forecast VMD-STAK-BOXCOX model;three-days-ahead forecast VMD-STACK-CORR model;machine learning algorithm models;forecasting errors;machine learning models;Bitcoin price forecasting;ensemble learning methods;data-driven approaches","","6","","38","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study constructs time-series models to examine DeFi- and NFT-related cryptocurrencies and to clarify how their weekly prices fluctuated over a one-year period. Using Google Trends data, we measure how weekly Internet searches into crypto markets generally and specific branded cryptocurrencies affected price fluctuations for each coin.

The colossal high points and low points in digital forms of money costs have drawn in analysts from the scholarly community as well as ventures to foresee their costs.

However, Dash coin is an individual cryptocurrency, but it is derived from Bitcoin and Litecoin. The change in Bitcoin and Litecoin prices affects the Dash coin price. Motivated from these, we present a cryptocurrency price prediction framework in this paper. It acknowledges different cryptographic forms of money (which are subject to one another) as information and yields higher accuracy. To illustrate this concept, we have considered a price prediction of Dash coin through the past days’ prices of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin as they have hierarchical dependency among them at the protocol level.

In this study, we use advanced artificial intelligence frameworks of fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to analyse the price dynamics of Bitcoin, Etherum, and Ripple. We find that ANN tends to rely more on long-term history while LSTM tends to rely more on short-term dynamics, which indicate the efficiency of LSTM to utilise useful information hidden in historical memory is stronger than ANN. However, given enough historical information ANN can achieve a similar accuracy, compared with LSTM. This study provides a unique demonstration that Cryptocurrency market price is predictable.

Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model, we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206704","Market Stock Prediction;Bitcoin (BTC);Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX);Recurrent Neural Network (RNN);Sentiment Analysis","Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Bitcoin;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Twitter","autoregressive moving average processes;crowdsourcing;cryptocurrencies;feature extraction;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;sentiment analysis;share prices;stock markets;time series","asset pricing;Bitcoin price trend;deep learning;Bitcoin market stocks;recurrent neural network;sentiment feature;Bitcoin time series predictions;sentiment driven price prediction;crowdsourced data;cryptocurrency;financial feature extraction;sentiment feature extraction;autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous input;ARIMAX","","11","","34","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Volatility measures the variation of a time series data, and thus it is also a driving factor for the risk forecasting of returns from investment in cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is a decentralized medium of exchange that relies on cryptographic primitives to facilitate the trustless transfer of value between different parties. Instead of being physical money, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries on an online ledger called blockchain that describe specific transactions.Many commonly used risk forecasting models do not take into account the uncertainty associated with the volatility of an underlying asset to obtain the risk forecasts. Some tools from the fuzzy set theory can be incorporated into the forecasting models to account for this uncertainty. Interest in the use of hybrid models for fuzzy volatility forecasts is growing. However, a major drawback is that the fuzzy coefficient hybrid models used in fuzzy volatility forecasts are not data-driven. This paper uses fuzzy set theory with data-driven volatility and data-driven neuro-volatility forecasts to study the fuzzy risk forecasts. The study focuses on long-term volatility forecasts with daily price data while briefly exploring forecasting models with high-frequency (hourly) data as an avenue for future research. Simple yet effective models incorporating fuzziness to obtain fuzzy risk volatility forecasts and fuzzy VaR forecasts are presented. The key underlying idea, unlike the existing risk forecasting, is the use of a hybrid nonlinear adaptive fuzzy model for volatility.","2640-7701","978-1-6654-4234-3","10.1109/CIFEr52523.2022.9776213","University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776213","Fuzzy risk forecasting;Asymteric Nonlinear Adaptive fuzzy number;Data-driven volatility","Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Robustness","cryptocurrencies;economic forecasting;finance;fuzzy set theory;investment;pricing;risk analysis;time series","fuzzy VaR forecasts;existing risk forecasting;hybrid nonlinear adaptive fuzzy model;fuzzy risk forecast intervals;data-driven volatility models;neuro-volatility models;time series data;cryptocurrency payments;commonly used risk forecasting models;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy volatility forecasts;fuzzy coefficient hybrid models;data-driven neuro-volatility forecasts;long-term volatility forecasts;daily price data;high-frequency data;fuzzy risk volatility forecasts","","","","29","IEEE","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ability to understand which factors drive the fluctuations of the Bitcoin price and to what extent they are predictable is interesting both from the theoretical and practical perspective. In this paper, we study the problem of the Bitcoin short-term volatility forecasting based on volatility history and order book data. Order book, consisting of buy and sell orders over time, reflects the intention of the market and is closely related to the evolution of volatility. We propose temporal mixture models capable of adaptively exploiting both volatility history and order book features.

C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time - rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered.

Since investment on bitcoin is increasing day to day and the bitcoin price fluctuates frequently, traders need a way to predict its price in prior so that the risks associated with it can be reduced and capital gain can be improved. The various existing works on price prediction have low accuracy and predict short term price only. Due to the difficulty of determining the exact existence of a Time Series model, it is difficult to generate appropriate forecasts. The Proposed technique uses deep learning to predict bitcoin prices with Recurrent Neural Network model using the time series data to provide the better accuracy. The novelty of work is to obtain a long-term prediction, the recurrent neural network model is trained and tested on the available dataset. This work predicts the value of bitcoin for the year 2021.

Predicting changes in cryptocurrency price is a hugely important topic to investors and researchers, with much existing research on demand-side factors. The goal of this research project is to design and implement machine learning models to predict future cryptocurrency price change direction based primarily on supply-side factors. Different unsupervised machine learning techniques are used to build the predictive models. These techniques include K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayesian Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. A dataset of 10 daily supply-side metrics for three prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin) at four different time horizons (ranging from one day to 30 days) are used to build and test the machine learning models. The outputs of these models indicate the predicted direction of the price movement over the time horizon (i.e., whether the price would go up or down), not the magnitude of the movement. Experimental results show that predictions were very unreliable for the shorter time spans but very reliable for the longest time spans. The Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest classifiers consistently outperformed the other techniques and achieved a prediction accuracy of over 90% in most models and over 95% in the best models. Experimental results show also that there is no significant difference in predictability between the three prominent cryptocurrencies.","","978-1-6654-8453-4","10.1109/AIIoT54504.2022.9817249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817249","Machine learning;classification;cryptocurrency;Bitcoin;Ethereum;Litecoin","Support vector machines;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Distance measurement;Cryptocurrency;Reliability","cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;pattern classification;random forests;support vector machines;unsupervised learning","supply-side factors;machine learning methods;investors;demand-side factors;machine learning models;predictive models;support vector machines;naive Bayesian classifier;predicted direction;price movement;time horizon;artificial neural network;random forest classifiers;supply-side metrics;unsupervised machine learning techniques;cryptocurrency price change direction;Bitcoin;Ethereum;Litecoin","","","","10","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Bitcoin (BTC) is the first decentralised CTC which garnered a lot of attention from the media as well as the public due to its ability to sustain the momentum in the market. However, investing in BTC is not the first choice of the investor due to the market’s erratic behaviour, price volatility and lack of a model that could be used to predict its price. In this direction, the present study aims in developing a time-series forecasting model that can efficiently as well as effectively predict the price of Bitcoins. For this purpose three machine learning (ML) models namely Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average method (ARIMA) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average method (SARIMA) models have been employed which are statistically scrutinised on the basis of the performance metrics namely Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and coefficient of determination (R2).

Predicting the price movement of crypto assets has a number of challenges, especially due to the high volatility of trading prices. Traditionally this process is carried out by conducting technical analysis using technical indicators which requires extensive knowledge and experience to get maximum profit in cryptocurrency trading. The CRISP-DM methodology was applied to create a classification model to predict the movement of the BTCUSDT cryptocurrency pair using a tree-based classification algorithm with the Gradient Boosting framework, namely the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). The Logistic Regression algorithm was used as a comparison. As input data, the klines dataset of the BTCUSDT cryptocurrency pair is used and feature engineering is carried out in the form of labelling (up/down) as well as a number of technical indicators commonly used in trading activities.

PIs are susceptible to monetary losses in the open market due to the aforementioned issues. The fraudsters could be both internal (operator of the scheme) and external (financial institutions (FI), such as banks, money-lenders, and insurance companies). The centrality of trust among stakeholders like PI, CF, and FI is a prime concern. Motivated from these facts, this paper proposes a decentralized framework, KaRuNa, A Blockchain-based Sentiment analysis framework for Fraud Cryptocurrency schemes. KaRuNa operates on public blockchain three phases of trust modeling among stakeholders. In the first phase, transactions are performed on the blockchain that offers trust, auditability, and transparency among stakeholders. In the second phase, sentiment analysis (SA) of cryptocurrencies is proposed based on a novel algorithm of hash addresses to generate classification scores (CS). Parameters like social trends, rise/fall in cryptocurrency price, measured standard deviation, peak and low are selected to fed to proposed novel Long-short term memory (LSTM) classifier to generate recommendations based on CS. An accuracy of 98.99% is achieved using LSTM over generated CS to evaluate risks in the investment. Results demonstrate that KaRuNa achieves more scalability compared to conventional approaches.","2474-9133","978-1-7281-7440-2","10.1109/ICCWorkshops49005.2020.9145151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145151","Blockchain;sentiment analysis;deep-learning;cryptocurrency;fraud schemes","Sentiment analysis;Investment;Bitcoin;Data mining;Stakeholders","banking;cryptocurrencies;data mining;financial data processing;fraud;investment;pattern classification;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","cryptocurrency transactions;modus-operandi;money generation;open market;money-lenders;stakeholders;decentralized framework;KaRuNa;Blockchain-based Sentiment analysis framework;public blockchain;cryptocurrency price;current open cryptocurrency markets;fraud cryptocurrency schemes","","10","","30","IEEE","21 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study adopts a deep learning technique called relation networks (RNs) to predict the exchange rates of fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To discover the relationship among different currencies, the concept of visual question answering (VQA) is applied in RNs. We also propose a specially designed architecture for the feature extraction stage to consider both spatial and temporal relationships simultaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve higher prediction performance for cryptocurrencies with approximately 65% accuracy rate.

Therefore the intelligent management and under-standing the characteristics of cryptocurrencies are becoming more interesting. The price of cryptocurrencies are characterized by linear and nonlinear trend, seasonality and high volatility, which increases the risk factors for investors. This study ex-periments with three different time series forecasting methods, specifically considered for Cryptocurrencies price such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR) and Cardano (XRP), and devises a procedure to evaluate their performance. Time series data are collected and examined using descriptive statistics. In next step, the White Neural Network is used for Non-Linearity and Dickey-Fuller for nonstationary and correlation among different settings of datasets. Based on these analyses, we evaluate efficient financial forecasting models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric, Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal (TBATS) and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) with reference to different parameters configuration of these models. The performance is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) criterion and models are ranked by statistical mean and standard deviation of MAPE values. The NNAR model gives minimum MAPE of 2.823 while the minimum convergence time of 4.9835s is observed with TBATS and hence, these are ranked at top amongst other models respectively. These results underpin that neural network-based models perform equally well on both types of nonlinear and linear financial data and, thus, have the potential to improve the impact of financial transaction and cryptocurrencies price bringing more innovation in the decision making process.","","978-1-6654-6837-4","10.1109/IICAIET55139.2022.9936798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9936798","ARIMA;NNAR;TBATS;Cryptocurrencies Forecasting;Bitcoin;Ethereum","Analytical models;Technological innovation;Correlation;Time series analysis;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Market research","autoregressive moving average processes;blockchains;cryptocurrencies;decision making;forecasting theory;investment;mean square error methods;neural nets;time series","minimum convergence time;TBATS;neural network-based models;cryptocurrencies price;blockchain-based cryptocurrencies;performance evaluation;ARIMA;investment purposes;intelligent management;high volatility;time series forecasting methods;time series data;descriptive statistics;nonlinearity;financial forecasting models;ARMA errors;neural network autoregressive;parameters configuration;root mean square error;mean absolute percentage error criterion;statistical mean;NNAR model;white neural network;autoregressive integrated moving average;standard deviation;decision making process","","","","29","IEEE","9 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has become a tool for predicting future trends based on what is known beforehand. Like other financial stock markets, cryptocurrency has become a new sensation and challenge for investors to predict its behaviour. However, unlike other financial instruments, cryptocurrency has been renowned because of the difficulty to predict the price due to its volatility behaviour that changes so rapidly and since there is no fundamental economy for its value. This paper presents a performance comparison of two ML algorithms in predicting Ethereum price with non-time series analysis, which are k- Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and multiple polynomial regression (MPR). The experiment used independent variables from related real-world economic fundamentals such as Dow Jones Index, gold price, oil price, and Ethereum volume. The experiment data was collected from the records from April 2017 until April 2021. For each algorithm, several methods of preprocessing data were used to match all independent data with the dependent data. Three different preprocessing scenarios were also used to find the maximum accuracy model. scenario 1 (feature selection based on correlation matrix), scenario 2 (feature selection based on correlation with the dependent variables and among independent variables), and scenario 3 (scenario 1 extracted with PCA). The performance of the compared methods was evaluated by using MSE and MAE. From the experiment, a comparison of results using two different models with k-NN and multiple polynomial regression is obtained. It is found that k-NN with a hyperparameter K = 2 have the best prediction with MSE = 449.032 and MAE = 14.282 compared with multiple polynomial regression with the best MSE = 13953.96 and MAE = 84.923.","","978-1-6654-9696-4","10.1109/QIR54354.2021.9716169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716169","crypocurrency;k-NN;multiple polynomial regression","Gold;Correlation;Oils;Data preprocessing;Prediction algorithms;Feature extraction;Market research","economic forecasting;feature selection;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);nearest neighbour methods;pricing;principal component analysis;regression analysis;stock markets;time series","k-NN;multiple polynomial regression;real-world economic fundamentals;gold price;oil price;Ethereum volume;feature selection;Ethereum price prediction comparison;machine learning algorithms;future financial trends;financial stock markets;cryptocurrency;financial instruments;ML algorithms;nontime series analysis;PCA;Dow Jones Index","","","","16","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government agencies resulting in prices being strongly influenced by public opinion. Understanding the relationship between cryptocurrency prices and the public sentiment can lead to improved predictions of price movement. In this paper, we give an exploratory analysis of a network of 24 Reddit communities related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies to analyze Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements. We engineer a set of 112 time series features from submissions and comments made on the selected subreddits, run Granger causality tests on engineered time series against cryptocurrency price movements, and use these time series to forecast the cryptocurrency price movements using classification models. Results from these models support the Granger causality test results showing that with only lagged price values and lagged values from a single Reddit data derived feature, the direction of Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements can be predicted with 74.2% and 73.1% accuracy respectively.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999092","Cryptocurrency, PageRank, time series analysis, Granger causality, sentiment analysis, Gradient Boosting Machines","Time series analysis;Bitcoin;Predictive models;Social network services;Sentiment analysis","causality;cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;pricing;social networking (online);time series","Bitcoin;cryptocurrencies;Ethereum price movements;cryptocurrency price movements;Reddit network sentiment;Granger causality;time series features;public sentiment;classification models","","1","","27","IEEE","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, the recent trend in the PQC field has gradually switched to the hardware acceleration aspect. Following this trend, this work presents a novel implementation of a High-performance Polynomial Multiplication hardware Accelerator for NTRU (HPMA-NTRU) under different parameter settings, one of the lattice-based PQC algorithm that is currently under the consideration by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization process. In total, we have carried out three layers of efforts to obtain the proposed work. First of all, we have proposed a new schoolbook algorithm based strategy to derive the desired polynomial multiplication algorithm for NTRU. Then, we have mapped the algorithm to build a high-performance polynomial multiplication hardware accelerator and have extended this hardware accelerator to different parameter settings with proper adjustment. Finally, through a series of complexity analysis and implementation based comparison, we have shown that the proposed hardware accelerator obtains better area-time complexities than the state-of-the-art one. The outcome of this work is important and will impact the ongoing NIST PQC standardization process and can be deployed further to construct efficient NTRU cryptoprocessors.","2765-933X","978-1-6654-5938-9","10.1109/DFT56152.2022.9962336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962336","High-performance;NTRU;polynomial multiplication hardware accelerator;post-quantum cryptography (PQC)","Quantum computing;Standardization;Switches;NIST;Very large scale integration;Market research;Public key cryptography","computational complexity;cryptography;polynomials;public key cryptography;quantum computing;quantum cryptography","desired polynomial multiplication algorithm;different parameter settings;efficient NTRU cryptoprocessors;existing public-key cryptosystems;hardware acceleration aspect;High-performance Polynomial Multiplication Accelerator;high-performance polynomial multiplication hardware accelerator;HPMA-NTRU;large-scale quantum computers;lattice-based PQC algorithm;ongoing NIST PQC standardization process;post-quantum cryptography;PQC field;quantum attacks","","","","43","IEEE","30 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cryptocurrency price prediction is a challenging problem with non-stationary market price and volatility clustering. Cryp-tocurrency data tends to be non-stationary, which means that predictive information extracted using deep learning techniques on observed data can not be used with future data. Moreover, there is a very little signal in cryptocurrency data to indicate the future direction of the market. This paper proposes a sensible way to frame the prediction problem as a dynamic regression problem by defining the features in the feedforward neural networks and the target as an appropriate average of the historical data. The novelty of this paper is to use deep learning algorithms and statistical bootstrapping to obtain cryptocurrency price prediction and the corresponding prediction intervals. It is shown that neural networks are capable of modelling nonlinearity directly for nonlinear time series models. The proposed hybrid approach is evaluated using simulated and cryptocurrency data through numerical experiments.

Fuzzy set theory has a unique ability to quantitatively and qualitatively model and analyze such problems. Volatility forecasting plays an important role in financial risk management and in option pricing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in data-driven volatility models and neurovolatility models for risk forecasting of stocks and index funds. However, even these state-of-the-art models do not take into account the fuzzy volatility in their risk forecasts.Cryptocurrencies are a novel financial asset class based on the Blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity among retail investors as a financial asset with high risks and high returns. The extremely volatile nature of cryptocurrencies (compared to traditional assets) makes forecasting their volatility more challenging. A simple algorithmic trading approach, Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy, is used to calculate the Algo returns. This paper provides fuzzy forecasts of the volatility of Algo returns using the data-driven Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (DD-EWMA) and neuro models for six major cryptocurrencies. We also compute and compare fuzzy volatility forecasts of four major tech stocks and Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) volatility index (VIX) using DD-EWMA and neuro models. Our experimental results show that the data-driven models produce better forecasts for cryptocurrencies as compared to the neuro models, while for the regular stocks and indexes, no such definitive conclusion could be drawn.","1558-4739","978-1-6654-6710-0","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE55066.2022.9882812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9882812","Fuzzy intervals;Cryptocurrency;Volatility Forecasting;Data-driven volatility;Neuro-volatility;Sharpe ratio;Algo return;Simple Moving Average","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Pricing;Predictive models;Cryptocurrency","finance;financial data processing;financial management;fuzzy set theory;investment;pricing;risk management;stock markets","cryptocurrencies;high returns;extremely volatile nature;traditional assets;simple algorithmic trading approach;Simple Moving Average crossover strategy;Algo returns;data-driven Exponentially Weighted Moving Average;neuro models;fuzzy volatility forecasts;Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index;data-driven models;regular stocks;neuro-volatility fuzzy forecasts;forecasting problems;Computational Finance;imprecision;financial markets;fuzzy set theory;volatility forecasting;financial risk management;data-driven volatility models;neurovolatility models;risk forecasts;financial asset class","","","","28","IEEE","14 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use time series to image transformations as a preprocessing step for VAE to reduce dimensionality. After performing K-means clustering on VAE’s latent space, we provide DEC with cluster centroids from the previous step and retrain our network to do the clustering task.

One of the usages of blockchain is in digital currencies. Digital currency (cryptocurrency) is a new era for the global financial system. Cryptocurrencies draw significant attention from researchers because of their advantages. Although there are several risks (e.g., speculation, 51% attack) related to cryptocurrency, billions of dollars are invested in them, because of their transparency, traceability, low transaction cost, and highly profitable potential. In December 2017, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached almost $20,000.00 per coin. Such short-term, high gain potential attracts many new small investors. However, speculative movements raise many questions related to the safety and privacy of investors, just to name a few. To understand public opinions about cryptocurrency and speculative movements to protect small investors financial interests, sentiment analysis can be done by using social media activities of individuals who are interested or investing in cryptocurrencies. It is also one of the essential steps in the analysis to understand the profiles of the users. Therefore, in this paper, we determine the attitudes of social network users by analyzing the positivity and negativity of the comments about six cryptocurrencies. Results show that the positivity is higher than negativity, and there exist relations between price changes and attitudes. However, relations vary according to currency types. The results and analysis, which are provided in this paper, help new investors and developers to obtain opinions of social network users who are interested or investing in cryptocurrency.","2325-2626","978-1-7281-4905-9","10.1109/ICNC47757.2020.9049693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9049693","Cryptocurrency;Social Media;Attitude Analysis;Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment analysis;Privacy;Costs;Social networking (online);Online banking;Bitcoin;Position measurement","cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;investment;pricing;social networking (online)","investors;speculative movements;social network users;social media users;digital currency;cryptocurrency;negative comments","","5","","27","IEEE","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Quantum computers require a classical – i.e., non-quantum – electronic interface to drive quantum operations on quantum bits (qubits), and to read out their quantum state. As quantum processors scale up to comprise more and more cryogenic qubits, the availability of a cryogenic electronic controller is crucial to support such scaling by avoiding the many unreliable and bulky interconnects connecting the cryogenic devices to room-temperature controllers. In this talk, we will review the latest advances in cryo-CMOS electronics for quantum-computing applications, both by TU Delft and other academic and industrial researchers, so as to identify the current trends and the needs still to be addressed. In particular, we will focus on the progress in the development of the individual high-performance circuit blocks (ADC, PLL, LNA,…) and in the trend to integrate qubit drivers, readouts, and biasing in largescale SoCs. By addressing the unsolved issues in this rapidly growing research field, we will outline the path towards the future comprehensive cryo-CMOS electronic interfaces that will enable largescale quantum computers.","1930-8868","978-1-6654-0923-0","10.1109/VLSI-TSA54299.2022.9770986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9770986","","Qubit;Market research;Cryogenics;Computers;Very large scale integration;Vehicles;Roads","cryogenic electronics;cryogenics;cryptographic protocols;quantum computing;quantum cryptography;readout electronics;system-on-chip","quantum computing;largescale quantum computers;future comprehensive cryo-CMOS electronic interfaces;qubit drivers;quantum-computing applications;cryo-CMOS electronics;room-temperature controllers;cryogenic devices;bulky interconnects;unreliable interconnects;cryogenic electronic controller;cryogenic qubits;quantum processors scale;quantum state;quantum bits;quantum operations;electronic interface;conference proceedings;complete presentation;summary form","","","","","IEEE","10 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Popular machine and statistical forecasting methods have been used to detect these manipulations and the road maps to be followed in order to be detected in the most successful way have been shared. Social media sentiments, which were thought to have an effect on manipulations during the studies, were also evaluated with the most advanced text analysis methods and evaluated together with these price changes. The allegations that the prediction methods carried out before the crisis were more successful were investigated. The Covid-19 pandemic was evaluated as a period of global crisis and the studies that might be relevant were examined. It would not be wrong to say that the actors that make big gains in the stock markets are the ones that determine the direction of the stock market. The manipulation periods of the market actors to be successful in the virtual money markets have been tried to be verified by various estimation methods.

Protein folding has been one of the most interesting areas to study, and it is also one of the biggest problems of biochemistry. Each protein folds distinctively, and the difficulty of finding its stable shape rapidly increases with an increase in the number of amino acids in the chain. A moderate protein has about 100 amino acids, and the number of combinations one needs to verify to find the stable structure is enormous. At some point, the number of these combinations will be so vast that classical computers cannot even attempt to solve them. In this paper, we examine how this problem can be solved with the help of quantum computing using two different algorithms, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate optimization Algorithm (QAOA), using Qiskit Nature.

CNN is extensively used in the area of image recognition and object detection for classification purposes. CNN is composed of several layers of filters to get feature maps of input data, yet foremost and crucial one is convolutional layer, hence the name Convolutional neural networks. However, the growth of quantum computing and quantum neural network in deep learning is limited. Three main obstacles that limit the growth of these are, first is due to the lack of real-time quantum computers to experiment with. Second is the improper training algorithms and at last, non-linearity nature of the neural networks. This paper introduces a novel approach to begin one's journey in quantum computing, along with solutions and developments. This work provides a detailed description of architectures, frameworks and algorithms used for implementing a QCNN model. The research was made regarding image recognition and object detection using QCNN and found that QCNN can increase the computational speeds with better performance metrics compared to classical computational methods.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol.

There have been a number of research studies that have presented bitcoin price prediction models, but none of them have looked at the controlling variables linked with bitcoin transaction timestamps. It might be that price is not the only key criteria influencing bitcoin transactions, or the available model for bitcoin price prediction is yet to consider timestamp as a determining factor in its transaction. A better and more accurate model would be required to predict how the Timestamp influences changes of bitcoin transactions. That is why this current study utilized a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the prediction of timestamp influence on Bitcoin value. Bitcoin historical datasets which are converted to a nonlinear regression into a “well-formulated” statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression are used. Simulation analysis indicates that bitcoin digital currency’s performance variation is highly influenced by its transaction timestamp with the prediction accuracy of 96%. The contributions of this research lies with the fact that specific Bitcoin transaction events repeat themselves over and over again, meaning that the Open-Price, High-Price, Low-Price, and Close-Price of Bitcoin price over timestamp developed a pattern that was predicted by NARX with less That means those involved in the transaction of bitcoin at the wrong timestamp will certainly face the uncertainty negative effect of the bitcoin market.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124629","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), University of Jeddah, Jeddah(grant numbers:UJ-20-121-DR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597552","Bitcoin (digital currency);volume of BTC;bitcoin;timestamp","Bitcoin;Predictive models;Uncertainty;Bayes methods;Online banking;Computer science;Social networking (online)","autoregressive processes;computer simulation;cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;neural nets;pricing;regression analysis","bitcoin transaction timestamps;NARX;nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neural network model;bitcoin value;nonlinear regression;specific Bitcoin transaction events;high-price;low-price;bitcoin market;bitcoin price prediction models;timestamp influence prediction;bitcoin historical datasets;ridge regression;simulation analysis;bitcoin digital currency performance;open-price;close-price","","","","57","CCBY","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we focus on the case when the observers perform a kind of a minimum-error type state discriminating measurement where the goal of the observers is to maximize their joint probability of successfully guessing the state that the qubit was initially prepared in. We call this the Joint Best Guess strategy. In this scheme, Alice prepares a qubit in one of two possible states. The qubit is first sent to Bob, who measures it, and then on to Charlie, and so on to altogether N consecutive receivers who all perform measurements on it. The goal for all observers is to determine which state Alice sent. In the Joint Best Guess strategy, every time a system is received the observer is required to make a guess, aided by the measurement, about its state. The price to pay for this requirement is that errors must be permitted, the guess can be correct or in error. There is a nonzero probability for all the receivers to successfully identify the initially prepared state, and we maximize this joint probability of success. This work is a step toward developing a theory of nondestructive sequential quantum measurements and could be useful in multiparty quantum communication schemes based on communicating with single qubits, particularly in schemes employing continuous variable states. It also represents a case where subsequent observers can probabilistically and optimally get around both the collapse postulate and the no-broadcasting theorem.","","978-1-7281-8969-7","10.1109/QCE49297.2020.00037","Army Research Laboratory(grant numbers:W911NF-20-2-0097); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259977","quantum information;quantum communication;sequential state discrimination","Receivers;Qubit;Observers;Extraterrestrial measurements;Protocols;Probabilistic logic;Optimization","probability;quantum computing;quantum cryptography;quantum entanglement","multiparty quantum communication schemes;N consecutive receivers;continuous variable states;single qubits;nondestructive sequential quantum measurements;initially prepared state;state Alice;joint probability;minimum-error type state discriminating measurement;sequential state discrimination measurements","","2","","18","IEEE","25 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent development of Bitcoin as a speculative asset and the herein skyrocketing Bitcoin price greatly incentivize participation in the network. We posit that the expansion in Bitcoin miner population and speculative transactions may not be socially desirable. The increased competition in Bitcoin mining not only exacerbates energy consumption and environmental cost, but also makes the risky mining business much riskier. In addition to the risk of unstable reward flows, the fluctuation in Bitcoin price makes the profitability of mining more uncertain. This research studies an alternative socially optimal model for the Bitcoin market (and other cryptocurrencies in general).

In the rest of this paper we will use the terms “Bitcoin price” and “Bitcoin's exchange rate” interchangeably to represent the amount of fiat currency (USD) needed to buy one Bitcoin at a given time. We consider, besides classical properties, a novel notion of Trustful Transaction Graph introduced to describe partial Users Graphs derived by chains of 0-confirmation transactions. We present a temporal analysis of the evolution of a set of features with a single day granularity. Afterwards, we applied autoregressive distributed-lag linear regression to assess whether and with which strength and duration a change in the considered features is likely to influence the exchange rate up to a prespecified number of days (fifteen) in the future. The results show that some of the considered features significantly influence the exchange rate up to several days, and that such relationships are likely not to be spurious, since we found that those features contribute significantly to decrease the error in predicting the exchange rate.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2020.3008600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9138785","Bitcoin;price analysis;autoregressive distributed-lag linear regression;users graph.","Bitcoin;Exchange rates;Blockchain;Tools;Linear regression;Computer science","autoregressive processes;cryptocurrencies;data analysis;exchange rates;financial data processing;graph theory;regression analysis;transaction processing","popular cryptocurrency;Bitcoin Users Graph;Bitcoin exchange rate;Bitcoin price;0-confirmation transactions;trustful transaction graph;autoregressive distributed-lag linear regression;topological properties","","2","","33","IEEE","10 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The price of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile and is prone to rapid swings within short periods of time. This behaviour makes them a high-risk and high-return financial asset. The efficacy of neural networks in forecasting the high frequency financial time series has become widely accepted in the research community. This work explored the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a neural network based non-linear sequence model, to propose a novel algorithmic trading strategy for cryptocurrencies. The proposed novel high frequency algorithmic trading strategy built over an LSTM based short-term price forecasting is used for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This simple, yet effective trading algorithm uses the network's price forecasts to make buy and short selling decisions for cryptocurrency based on certain set criteria. The proposed trading strategy gives positive returns when backtested on Bitcoin hourly prices taken from yahoo! finance. We also verified the effectiveness of the trading strategy for Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, based on the positive backtesting returns. As an extension to the study, the proposed strategy is applied on an even higher frequency (minute by minute) Bitcoin price data, and the strategy gives positive backtesting returns in this extended study. We also provide fuzzy intervals for the algorithmic return of our strategy and compare those with corresponding intervals on a simple buy and hold strategy.","","978-1-6654-8768-9","10.1109/SSCI51031.2022.10022021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10022021","LSTM;Cryptocurrency;Fuzzy intervals;Mem-bership function;Financial time series;Algorithmic Trading;High Frequency Trading;Neural Networks;Time Series Fore-casting","Time-frequency analysis;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Time series analysis;Finance;Bitcoin;High frequency","cryptocurrencies;electronic trading;financial data processing;fuzzy set theory;pricing;recurrent neural nets;time series","algorithmic return;algorithmic trading model;alternative financial asset;Bitcoin hourly prices;buy;effective trading algorithm;Ethereum;high frequency financial time series;high-return financial asset;high-risk;higher frequency;largest cryptocurrency;Long Short Term Memory;LSTM;neural network;nonlinear sequence model;novel algorithmic trading strategy;novel high frequency algorithmic trading strategy;positive backtesting returns;positive returns;rapid swings;research community;short selling decisions;short-term price forecasting","","","","27","IEEE","30 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, Bitcoin’s erratic behavior has discouraged some potential investors. To get insights into its behavior and price fluctuation, past studies have discovered the correlation between Twitter sentiments and Bitcoin behavior. Most of them have exclusively focused on their relationships, instead of the Twitter sentiment analysis itself. Finding the most suitable classification algorithms for sentiment analysis for this kind of data is challenging. For the enormous data in Twitter, the supervised sentiment analysis approach of unlabeled data can be time-consuming and expensive, which has been studied to be superior to unsupervised ones. As such, we propose the HyVADRF (hybrid valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner (VADER)–random forest) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) model. A semantic and rule-based VADER was used to calculate polarity scores and classify sentiments, which overcame the weakness of manual labeling, while a random forest was utilized as its supervised classifier. Furthermore, considering Twitter’s massive size, we collected over 3.6 million tweets and analyzed various dataset sizes as these are related to the model’s learning process. Lastly, GWO parameter tuning was conducted to optimize the classifier’s performance. The results show that 1) the HyVADRF model had an accuracy of 75.29%, precision of 70.22%, recall of 87.70%, and F1-score of 78%. 2) The most ideal dataset size percentage is 90% of the total collected tweets ( $n =1$ ,249,060). 3) The standard deviations are 0.0008 for accuracy and F1-score and 0.0011 for precision and recall. Hence, the HyVADRF model consistently delivers stable results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3209662","Digital Science for Economy, Society, Human Resources Innovative Development and Environment Project through Reinventing Universities and Research Institutes(grant numbers:2046735); APNIC (Asia Pacific Network Information Centre) Foundation through SWITCH SEA (Supporting Women in Internet Research Leaders in Southeast Asia) Project-TH-03, for data science and applied AI professional knowledge, and research support; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9903427","Hyperparameter;random forest;bitcoin;gray wolf optimization;tweet sentiment analysis;VADER","Sentiment analysis;Blogs;Social networking (online);Bitcoin;Classification algorithms;Data models;Semantics","data mining;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","Twitter's massive size;3.6 million tweets;GWO parameter tuning;HyVADRF model;hybrid VADER-random forest;Bitcoin tweet sentiment;Bitcoin's erratic behavior;price fluctuation;Twitter sentiments;Bitcoin behavior;Twitter sentiment analysis;suitable classification algorithms;enormous data;supervised sentiment analysis approach;unlabeled data","","","","54","CCBY","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the centralized computing topology of classical electric information system, where individual electricity consumption data are frequently transmitted to the cloud center for load forecasting, tends to violate electric consumers’ privacy as well as to increase the pressure on network bandwidth. To tackle the tricky issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework based on the edge-fog-cloud continuum for smart grid. Specifically, 1) we gravitate the training of load forecasting models and forecasting workloads to distributed smart meters so that consumers’ raw data are handled locally, and only the forecasting outputs that have been protected are reported to the cloud center via fog nodes; 2) we protect the local forecasting models that imply electricity features from model extraction attacks by model randomization; 3) we exploit a shuffle scheme among smart meters to protect the data ownership privacy, and utilize a re-encryption scheme to guarantee the forecasting data privacy. Finally, through comprehensive simulation and analysis, we validate our proposed privacy-preserving framework in terms of privacy protection, and computation and communication efficiency.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-3106-1","10.1109/WCNC45663.2020.9120680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9120680","","Data privacy;Cloud computing;Load forecasting;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Data models;Smart meters","Big Data;cryptography;data privacy;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;power consumption;power engineering computing;smart meters;smart power grids","planning;maintenance;smart grid;energy internet;short-term load forecasting;big data;machine learning technologies;centralized computing topology;classical electric information system;individual electricity consumption data;cloud center;electric consumers;edge-fog-cloud continuum;forecasting workloads;distributed smart meters;fog nodes;local forecasting models;electricity features;model extraction attacks;model randomization;data ownership privacy;forecasting data privacy;privacy protection;privacy-preserving framework","","1","","24","IEEE","19 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The difficult part is that market is dynamic in a way that is driven by many factors including inflation rate, economics, and natural calamities. This creates a chaos in the price of index so does the sentiment of the investor. This study proposes a machine learning model that applies a combination of sentiment-based support vector machine that is optimized by the whale optimization algorithm for predicting the daily price of a digital currency. Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique is used with the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) which is inspired by the swarm optimization algorithms. The proposed Hybrid Sentiment-based Support Vector Machine with a Whale Optimization Algorithm (SVMWOA). will be evaluated and compared based on performance measures.

This work proposes the use of Mamdani interpretable fuzzy inference models for forecasting cryptocurrency price variation. For that, a genetic algorithm to optimize models accuracy is employed, limiting the quantity of rules and antecedents arbitrarily. A set of infeasible rules had to be discarded, in order to generate interesting models, that produce a relevant amount of trades. Data from Kraken exchange were utilized for training, validation and results assessment. Results have shown that, for the cryptocurrencies with the highest validation performances, there are gains in comparison to the simple currency appreciation.

Traditionally known in the world of penny stocks and made illegal in most countries, pump and dump schemes are frequent in cryptocurrencies, and mostly unregulated. In this paper, we perform quantification and detection of pump and dump schemes that are coordinated through Telegram chats and executed on Binance - one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. We detail how pumps are organized on Telegram, and quantify the properties of 149 confirmed events with respect to market capitalization, trading volume, price impact and profitability. Based on this ground truth, and regular trading intervals obtained from twitter timestamps, we optimize a binary classifier in order to be able to detect additional suspicious trading activity. Our results indicate that pump and dump schemes occur frequently in cryptocurrencies with market capitalizations below $50 million, that scheme operators often organize their actions across multiple channels, that such activity tends to lead to inflated prices over longer time periods and machine learning can help to identify activity that is similar to known pump and dump schemes.","2375-9259","978-1-7281-4896-0","10.1109/ICDMW.2019.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955594","cryptocurrencies;manipulation;trading","Blockchain;Bitcoin;Investment;Smart contracts","cryptocurrencies;pricing;stock markets","price changes;cryptocurrency exchanges;price impact;profitability;scheme operators;known pump;cryptocurrency pump scheme;cryptocurrency dump scheme;telegram chats;Binance","","7","","24","IEEE","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency nowadays, has the highest market capitalization among other currencies. Which means that any major change in its price tendency will definitely affect the whole market and therefore other coins’ prices will surely rise or fall accordingly. We can assume that the greatest concern ever of all the traders around the world is to be alerted or aware of such major price tendency shifts in real time, in which may help them gain more profit or cut losses before it is late, or in either way predict the potential market movement of other digital currencies. It is reported that emotional interactions of the social media users especially on Twitter (one of the most globally used micro-blogging social networks especially related to cryptocurrency topics) have a great influence on the trend of the Bitcoin price. The huge number of daily active Twitter users with the enormous volume of tweets related to Bitcoin price tendency makes it remarkable regarding its impact on Bitcoin market interaction. In this paper, we will implement Apache Spark logistic regression model to process the large-scale data after having a sentimental analysis of Twitter tweets regarding Bitcoin, to predict the upcoming price tendency and classify an awareness level to alert potential traders and investors in real time about such potential market changes.","","978-1-6654-9796-1","10.1109/ISDFS55398.2022.9800793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9800793","Bitcoin(BTC);bitcoin price prediction;twitter;sentiment analysis;Apache Spark;Awareness level","Social networking (online);Online banking;Blogs;Digital forensics;Bitcoin;Predictive models;Market research","","","","","","12","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We discuss the relationship between on/off-chain transactions and predict the implied price volatility of the next 30 days, which is the main factor in the BS model. First, we analyze the Blockchain statistics and social network trends of Bitcoin as inputs to our model, including the liveness of Blockchain wallet, the scale of active Blockchain nodes and the impact factor of Google, Reddit, Twitter to name a few. Next, we implement the LSTM-based prediction model and evaluate it in various historical window sizes and network parameters. Finally, we compare the performance with the baseline model without Blockchain statistics inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-input LSTM-based prediction model provides the risk-informed pricing of the Bitcoin call options and our Blockchain statistics reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by up to 46.2%.","","978-1-7281-4693-5","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946183","Bitcoin;Blockchain;Prediction;Deep learning;LSTM;Option pricing","Bitcoin;Blockchain;Predictive models;Pricing;Market research;Analytical models","cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;financial data processing;recurrent neural nets;share prices;social networking (online);statistical analysis","Bitcoin options pricing;LSTM-based prediction model;Black-Scholes model;implied price volatility;Blockchain wallet;risk-informed pricing;Blockchain statistics;cryptocurrencies;social network trends;Google;Reddit;Twitter;long short term memory recurrent neural networks","","10","","29","IEEE","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the current digital exchanging world, investors and interested parties are eager to know more information about, and the capabilites of, this new type of currency. One of the potential paths to retrieve the info automatically and quickly is through a chatbot. We explored the open source python library, Chatterbot, to apply Itchat API (a WeChat interface) with the aim of building a robot chatting application, I&C Chat, on the topic of cryptocurrency. First, we collected question and answer pairs datasets from Quora websites. Furthermore, we also created API calls to query the real time quote for the top 25 cryptocurrencies. Then we used the collected data to train our chatbot and implemented a logic adapter to receive the price quote of cryptocurrencies based on the incoming question. The Itchat API method will return the best matched answer to the asking party automatically. The response time of different questions has been investigated.

This objective requires to specify whether investors can extend their exposure in certain asset classes and benefit their portfolios in a statistically significant way. In this paper, we address this issue of diversification in the context of cryptoasset portfolios and examine whether their risk-adjusted performance can be enhanced through seeking exposure into the commodities class. For an equally-weighted portfolio of five cryptoassets, we first consider the addition of physical gold, as conceptualised by the CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index, a diversified, monthly-rebalanced index that seeks exposure to both asset classes. We further consider modifying the index composition by replacing physical gold with a basket of five commodities. Mean-variance spanning tests reveal that the addition of physical gold in the original cryptoasset portfolio translates to a significant shift in the efficient frontier, both in terms of the global minimum variance and the tangency portfolios. Additionally, expanding the exposure in the commodity side confirms a statistically significant improvement, with the diversification benefit arising from a shift in the tangency portfolio. We further generate a number of price paths for the original index, the modified index and their components, according to a Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH specification, to assess the efficiency of the index weighted risk contribution scheme. Results demonstrate a superior performance of the two indices when compared against their constituents in terms of Omega ratio. The modified index appears more appropriate for investors that seek higher annual returns, while the original composition would be more appropriate for individuals with moderate annual return goals.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461107","Cryptoassets;Gold;Commodities;Index;Mean-Variance Spanning;Diversification","Gold;Correlation;Conferences;Computational modeling;Blockchain;Cryptocurrency;Indexes","asset management;autoregressive processes;cryptography;financial data processing;investment;risk management;share prices;stock markets","diversification benefits;cryptoasset portfolios;investment portfolios;asset classes;commodities class;equally-weighted portfolio;physical gold;CoinShares Gold;Cryptoassets Index;index composition;mean-variance spanning tests;tangency portfolio;index weighted risk contribution scheme;global minimum variance;dynamic conditional correlation GARCH specification;generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity","","","","25","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to summarize the research problems, achievements and possible research trends based on Bitcoin data analysis. Therefore, in this paper we review the literatures about data analysis on Bitcoin transaction entities. Starting from the relevant conceptual framework of Bitcoin, this paper divides the existing research models into three categories, heuristic algorithm identification of entities, transaction descriptive statistics and network analysis, and visual system analysis. By analyzing the transaction entity, Bitcoin transaction data can be processed in a manner which is similar to an account, such as a bank or credit card, thereby achieving the purpose of in-depth analysis of all transaction activities related to the account entity.

Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions.

Given the high price and complexity, multi-tenancy has become a cost-effective pattern for QKD network operations. In this work, we concentrate on addressing the online multi-tenant provisioning (On-MTP) problem for QKD networks, where multiple tenant requests (TRs) arrive dynamically. On-MTP involves scheduling multiple TRs and assigning non-reusable secret keys derived from a QKD network to multiple TRs, where each TR can be regarded as a high-security-demand organization with the dedicated secret-key demand. The quantum key pools (QKPs) are constructed over QKD network infrastructure to improve management efficiency for secret keys. We model the secret-key resources for QKPs and the secret-key demands of TRs using distinct images. To realize efficient On-MTP, we perform a comparative study of heuristics and reinforcement learning (RL) based On-MTP solutions, where three heuristics (i.e., random, fit, and best-fit based On-MTP algorithms) are presented and a RL framework is introduced to realize automatic training of an On-MTP algorithm. The comparative results indicate that with sufficient training iterations the RL-based On-MTP algorithm significantly outperforms the presented heuristics in terms of tenant-request blocking probability and secret-key resource utilization.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.2964003","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601052,61822105); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019XD-A05); State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications of China(grant numbers:IPOC2019ZR01); China Association for Science and Technology, Swedish Research Council, Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, Swedish Foundation for International Collaboration in Research and Higher Education, and G??ran Gustafsson Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8950200","Quantum key distribution networks;online multi-tenant provisioning;heuristics;reinforcement learning","Security;Repeaters;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Optical fiber networks;Network architecture;Data communication","learning (artificial intelligence);private key cryptography;probability;quantum cryptography;scheduling","quantum key distribution networks;reinforcement learning;long-term security;QKD network operations;online multitenant provisioning;multiple tenant requests;high-security-demand organization;secret-key demand;quantum key pools;QKPs;QKD network infrastructure;secret-key resources;On-MTP algorithm;tenant-request blocking probability;secret-key resource utilization;data communications","","24","","67","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Security plays an increasingly important role in the coming decades in which attacking strategies are becoming more and more sophisticated. Contemporary cryptographic mechanisms face a great threat from quantum computers in the near future and together with Intrusion Detection Systems are hardly applicable on sensors due to strict resource constraints. Thus, in this work a future-proof lightweight and resource-aware security concept for sensor networks with a processing stage permeated filtering mechanism is proposed.

Inspired by AlphaGo's game ideas, after consulting the economic and financial research literature related to artificial intelligence at home and abroad, in order to maximize traders' returns, minimize risks, and optimize decisions, this paper proposes an intelligent body decision model based on deep reinforcement learning and applies it to the actual columns of this paper. an LSTM prediction model was established to predict the price of gold and Bitcoin, and it was found that the data fit worked best when the number of iterations was 100. Then, the CPMA model is established to establish a risk assessment mechanism and make preconditions for the decision-making model. Finally, a reinforcement learning model is established based on artificial intelligence, and LSTM is used to extract data features and is combined with DQN algorithm to solve. Based on the CPMA model of problem one, we correlate this improved model with transaction costs. And conduct descriptive statistics on the relationship between yield rate and cost of revenue. It can be seen that the transaction cost adjustment has a large short-term impact on the market, and the long-term impact is relatively small. Therefore, we recommend reducing costs appropriately to improve profitability.","","978-1-6654-7200-5","10.1109/ICDSCA56264.2022.9988461","Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2008085QD178); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9988461","Reinforcement Learning;CPMA;LSTM;DQN;T-test","Costs;Profitability;Biological system modeling;Reinforcement learning;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms","cryptocurrencies;decision making;decision theory;deep learning (artificial intelligence);economic forecasting;feature extraction;pricing;profitability;recurrent neural nets;reinforcement learning;risk management","AlphaGo game ideas;artificial intelligence;bitcoin;cost reduction;CPMA model;data feature extraction;deep reinforcement learning;descriptive statistics;DQN algorithm;economic research literature;financial research literature;intelligent body decision model;intelligent decision making system;LSTM prediction model;profitability;reinforcement learning model;revenue cost;risk assessment mechanism;risk minimization;trader return maximization;traditional forecasting models;transaction cost adjustment;yield rate","","","","7","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under these circumstances, in countries with cheap or subsidized electricity price, the introduction of profitable cryptocurrencies application is deeply penetrated. It has attracted many low-voltage customers to mine these digital currencies individually or in mining pools. The employed mining devices with their own unique constant load profile have escalated the coincident factor of the loads supplied by a transformer. This can highly overload the transformers engaged with loads of this type and, in the long term will cause destructive impacts not only on the transformer also on the distribution facilities. This paper studies the adverse effect of cryptocurrency mining loads on the distribution transformer aging. At first, the customer's profit analysis through mining operation has been introduced, realizing different electric energy pricing strategies. Finally, 105 real-world distribution substations have been monitored over one year, and their actual load profiles data are recorded for analysis. A relation between the penetration rate of the mining devices and the transformer's expected lifetime is determined in this work. It is shown that the distribution transformers' expected lifetime will decrease by 25% in the presence of only a 5% penetration rate of cryptocurrency miners. This is an alarming statistic for distribution networks operating under the presence of cryptocurrency mining loads. This should be strictly addressed in the future planning of these distribution networks.","","978-1-6654-5183-3","10.1109/EPDC56235.2022.9817210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817210","aging;b itco in;blockchain;cryptocurrency;distribution transformer","Substations;Online banking;Privatization;Power distribution;Distribution networks;Pricing;Transformers","cryptocurrencies;data mining;power distribution economics;power distribution planning;power engineering computing;power markets;power transformers;pricing;substations","cryptocurrency mining loads;cheap electricity price;subsidized electricity price;profitable cryptocurrencies application;digital currencies;mining pools;mining devices;constant load profile;distribution facilities;mining operation;real-world distribution substations;actual load profiles data;distribution networks;distribution transformer loss-of- life assessment;electric energy pricing strategies","","","","29","IEEE","14 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel machine-learning model, solving a binary classification problem, that can predict transaction fee volatility in the Bitcoin network so that users can optimize their fees expenses and the approval time for their transactions. The model's output will give a confidence score whether a new incoming transaction will be included in the next mined block. The model is trained on data from a longitudinal study of the Bitcoin blockchain, containing more than 10 million transactions. New features that we generate include information on how many bytes were already occupied by other transactions in the mempool, assuming they are ordered by fee density in each mining pool. The collected dataset allows to generate a model for transaction inclusion pattern prediction in the Bitcoin network, hence telling whether a transaction is well formed or not, according to the previous transactions analyzed.

This paper puts forward a new encryption/decryption algorithm that is based on the ASCII, Binary-Bit sequence and further uses the XOR operation. It insinuates encryption at compound stages and the key is imparted by the user.

With the advent of Smart Grids being developed world wide, the most widely accepted strategy is Demand-Response management. In this strategy, the customers or end-users are incentivized to change their energy-utility behavior with time in response to fluid price changes or to induce lower energy consumption during peak demand time. The system is controlled by a cloud of servers that monitor the demand- supply chain over a network all the time. This brings up the issue of security within the operations of the system.

This study first suggests a design for a ledger digital electricity generation network and explains the connections between and functions of every level. Eventually, Segment Byzantine Fault Resilience, a chain division unanimity mechanism for digital power plant payments, was put out (PPBFT). The method in this study may significantly minimize the acceptance time as the number of nodes rises and enhance the fairness and timeliness of payments, it is proven using C++ language to model the technique.","","979-8-3503-9826-7","10.1109/IC3I56241.2022.10072730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10072730","Virtual Power Plants;Blockchain;Consensus Algorithm;Hierarchical Partition;PPBFT;Machine Learning;OMNET+ and VPP","Network topology;Bitcoin;Production;Machine learning;Power grids;Blockchains;Partitioning algorithms","","","","","","12","IEEE","22 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The data sharing of multiple PV power stations in the same area can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of power generation. However, data integration often brings about problems of information security and data privacy. In order to solve the problem that data sharing and privacy protection can not be balanced, a PV power prediction model based on federated learning is proposed in this paper. On the premise of ensuring the information security of each local power data, the collection of decentralized data and joint multi-party data are constructed. At the same time, under the condition that the data of each power station are confidential to each other, the federated server collects the encrypted training parameters of each power station after local training for integration training, and makes PV power generation prediction without sacrificing security and privacy of the power station. The result shows the prospect of federated learning for forecasting the power of photovoltaic power stations without compromising privacy.","","978-1-83953-606-9","10.1049/icp.2021.2326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9654016","","","Big Data;cryptography;data integration;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;power generation planning","federated learning-based forecasting model;privacy protection;data sharing;photovoltaic power stations;big data;machine learning;multiple PV power stations;data integration;information security;data privacy;PV power prediction model;local power data;decentralized data;joint multiparty data;PV power generation prediction","","","","","","17 Dec 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In this scenario the DSO is interested in exploiting EV charges in terms of flexibility that can be planned in optimized way, especially when it is combined with high penetration of RES. This paper provides evidence that EVs charging sessions, planned using a dedicated forecasting module, can contribute to balance the distribution power network; for this purpose suitable flexibility-enabling technologies developed under the H2020 project SOFIE have been used. Data analysis has pointed out that a proper program of charging sessions could significantly increase self-consumption index; moreover, an optimal scheduling has been validated taking into account realistic constraints for its actual implementation. Finally, the paper shows how the enabling technologies for flexibility exploitation have been implemented and validated; notably, a rescheduling of the charging sessions is allowed through the usage of forecasting techniques as well as the implementation of blockchain technologies for enabling a flexibility marketplace.","","978-1-7281-7455-6","10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope49358.2020.9160781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9160781","Electric Vehicles;flexibility;self-consumption;reverse power flow;Distributed Ledger Technology;forecasting algorithm","Forecasting;Production;Load flow;Electric vehicle charging;Machine learning;Research and development;Europe","automobiles;cryptocurrencies;data analysis;distributed databases;distribution networks;power engineering computing;power generation planning;power generation scheduling;power grids","electric car usage;electric power network challenges;EV charges;forecasting module;distribution power network;optimal scheduling;blockchain technologies;electric vehicles;Europe","","5","","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it has been widely reported that it can be used for investment scams, which are referred to as high yield investment programs (HYIP). Although from the security forensic point of view it is very important to identify the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, so far in the open technical literature no systematic method which reliably collects and identifies such Bitcoin addresses has been proposed. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced, which efficiently collects a large number of the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses and identifies them based upon a novel analysis of their transactions history. In particular, a scraping-based method is first proposed which is able to collect more than 2,000 HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses from the Internet thus providing a large number of the HYIPs' samples. Second, a supervised machine learning technique, which classifies, whether or not, specific Bitcoin addresses belong to the HYIP operators, is introduced and its performance is evaluated. The proposed classification method is based upon two novel approaches, namely the rate conversion technique that mitigates the effect of Bitcoin price volatility and the sampling technique that reduces the computational amount without sacrificing the classification performance. By employing close to 30,000 real Bitcoin addresses, extensive performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulation experiments have shown that the proposed methodology achieves excellent performance, i.e., 95% of the HYIP addresses can be correctly classified, while maintaining a false positive rate less than 4.9%. In order to further validate the proposed classifier's ability to detect the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, our designed classifier has been tested against a recently published list of the HYIP addresses maintaining its excellent detection accuracy by achieving a 93.75% success rate.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2921087","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(grant numbers:JP18K18162); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731919","Bitcoin;blockchain analysis;forensics;data mining;HYIP (high yield investment programs)","Bitcoin;Blockchain;Investment;Forensics;History","cryptocurrencies;digital forensics;supervised learning","HYIP addresses;Bitcoin price volatility;supervised machine learning technique;scraping-based method;security forensic;high yield investment programs;investment scams;bitcoin addresses identification;HYIP operators","","36","","29","OAPA","5 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

TESAT's LCTs have successfully accomplished more than 25.000 links in the past six years. In this paper, an overview of the results generated during this time is presented. Eight LCTs 135, 1064 nm wavelength are/have been in operation in the past six years. Two LCTs are on board of geostationary satellites (GEOs) and six are/were on board of low-orbit satellites (LEOs) covering wide range of missions from earth observation (e.g. Copernicus program) and surveillance to technology demonstrator payloads (e.g. TDP1 Experimentation Program) [1] [2]. Space to ground links (SGLs) have been demonstrated using different art of optical ground stations (OGS). Upand down-optical links with and without communication between the Technology Demonstrator Payload 1 (TDP1) and the DLR Transportable Adaptive Optics Ground Station (T-AOGS) [12] have been used for experimental purpose, contributing to the data generation for atmospheric modelling and supporting the experts in building a better understanding of atmospheric impact onto the optical channel [3]. In order to implement and operate the LCTs, new operational concepts have been developed. Generation of operational products like link requests or commanding files has been supported and tuned [5] [2]. Further technology applications like airborne terminals are currently under validation. In 2019, several companies have started the verification of their terminals using the E2E test bed TDP1 and the T-AOGS described in [4]. Testing campaigns are ongoing in 2019. The TDP1 test bed has also supported quantum key distribution (QKD) verifications [7] [13] and optical channel characterization [9]. Methods for analysis, characterization and assessment of trends and performances of the LCTs in space and OGS have been developed and implemented. The Long Term Performance Analysis (LTPA) enables the assessment of potential degradations and allows for an introduction of corresponding counter measures (i.e. parameter settings modifications) preventing from negative impact on operations and services [6] [10]. The knowledge gained from the TDP1 Program has been an important contribution to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS).

Sliding window is used to obtain point cloud datasets from a multidimensional time series (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple). We apply persistent homology to quantify transient loops that appear in multiscale topological spaces, which associated on each point cloud dataset and encode the quantified information in a persistence landscape. Temporal changes in persistence landscapes are measured via their L1-norms. Consequently, a new representative is attained, called L1-norms time series. The L1-norms is associated with indicators: autocorrelation function at lag 1, variance and mean power spectrum at low frequencies to detect the signals. By using Kendall's tau correlation and significance test, significant rising trend events that occur before major financial crashes in Bitcoin are defined as the signals. A threshold is determined to scan entire data and record all the significant rising trend events. Lastly, we compare L1-norms with residuals time series, which is another representative obtained from de-trending approach. Our result portrays that autocorrelation function at lag 1 and variance of the L1-norms successfully detect early warning signals before the 2017 and 2019 major financial crashes. However, variance of the L1-norms is better since it able to signal another 2018 major financial crash. For the residuals, no early warning signals are detected. Hence, persistent homology provides a better representative than de-trending approach.

In this paper, we propose an improved FHE scheme based on HElib, which is a FHE library implemented based on Brakerski's FHE scheme. Our improvement focuses on two aspects. On the one hand, we first use the relinearization technique to reduce the ciphertext size, and then the modulus switching technique is used to reduce the modulus and decryption noise. On the other hand, we need no relinearization and modulus switching if there is additive homomorphic or no homomorphic operation in the multiplicative ciphertext's next homomorphic operation. Homomorphic comparison protocol, private hyperplane decision-based classification and private Naïve Bayes classification are implemented by additive homomorphic and multiplicative homomorphic first. In our homomorphic comparison protocol, the number of interactions is reduced from 3 to 1. We choose the proposed FHE scheme to implement private decision tree classification.

Transactions in the Ethereum network, such as invokations of smart contracts used to control an IoT device, have no fairness or eventuality guarantees.

To restore the computer's functionality and user files, the malware demands a ransom, which must be paid in the form of cryptocurrency within a stipulated period. The deleterious effects caused by ransomware must be detected and addressed promptly. It is often difficult to perceive the metrics and parameters to look for, particularly when conducting experiments with unfamiliar ransomware variants. Traditionally, analysis carried out on these suspicious files can be categorized as static or dynamic based analysis. Static-based signature analysis is tremendously affected because of its nature of generating hard-coded policies or rules. Attackers often attempt to breach them by employing various techniques like code obfuscation, encryption, packaging, etc. While the dynamic analysis provides more insights into the analyzed files. The proposed work observes the behavioral aspects of ransomware and builds a generic model using machine learning techniques to detect the variants of ransomware families. Such threats must be detected early, i.e., before encryption takes place. Early detection, however, is hampered by a lack of sufficient information in the early stages of an attack, which leads to low detection accuracy and a high rate of false alarms. Currently, available solutions assume that there is complete knowledge of the behavior of such attacks at the time of detection, but that is not the case. The same is not true for early detection which takes place during an attack when the data are not fully accessible. Our paper proposes a novel technique to address these limitations called Augmented Bootstrapping and this method analyses the API calls made by the ransomware along with their timestamps. These timestamps indicate the API call sequences, which in turn help in constructing the N-gram model. The names of API calls are concatenated together to generate the bigram, trigram, 4-gram, and 5-gram models. Further, TF-IDF scores will be calculated for each of these N-grams sequences, and a machine learning model will be trained based on these values. The method analyses API call sequences of each of the active applications in the system and confirms the ransomware attack when it matches a malicious call sequence pattern. Our empirical results confirm that the proposed work could detect ransomware attacks with high accuracy and fewer false predictions.","","978-1-6654-8328-5","10.1109/ICOEI53556.2022.9777099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9777099","Ransomware;Mitigation method;API Calls;N-Grams;Behavior model;Decision making","Training;Measurement;Machine learning;Packaging;Market research;Encryption;Behavioral sciences","application program interfaces;computer bootstrapping;cryptocurrencies;file organisation;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","malicious call sequence pattern;API call sequences;machine learning techniques;cryptocurrency;computer functionality;static based signature analysis;API calls;low detection accuracy;ransomware families;file analysis;dynamic analysis;encryption;dynamic based analysis;suspicious files;unfamiliar ransomware variants;computer;user files;infected computers;malware;augmented bootstrapping;automated dynamic detection;ransomware attack","","","","23","IEEE","24 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transactions substituting money over Ethereum space are carried out using Ethereum's cryptocurrency `Ether'. Though the decentralization and public ledger recording of the transactions proves its limpidity, the anonymity of the users, hiding their true identity behind the addresses echoes the need for discerning the behavioural traits in transactions. The appalling nature of Ethereum transactions to have both, security and threat at a comparable level, demands analytics for inferring traits for better perspectives and insights. This research work focuses on characteristic analysis of Ethereum transaction space for inferring behavioural traits in supervised and unsupervised context. In an unsupervised environment, raw transaction data is extradited to a tabular transaction structure by selecting appropriate features. The data is further clustered and validated to form coherent groupings of similar patterns. The clusters are characteristically analyzed based on the features through Radar plots for inferring behavioural traits. In supervised context, labelled transactions are represented using histograms and feature-based characteristic analysis is performed to infer traits. Such analytics lay foundations for future deeper analysis that can be used to discover trends and patterns to understand the transaction network, enhancement of trading strategies, identification of bot activities, anomaly detection and several others.","","978-1-7281-9080-8","10.1109/ICCP51029.2020.9266176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9266176","Ethereum;Blockchain;Analytics;Clustering;Behaviour","Radar;Blockchain;Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Market research;Smart contracts;Machine learning algorithms","behavioural sciences computing;contracts;cryptocurrencies;data analysis;financial data processing;financial management;pattern clustering;supervised learning;transaction processing;unsupervised learning","decentralized applications;Ethereum cryptocurrency;public ledger recording;Ethereum transactions;behavioural traits;histograms;feature-based characteristic analysis;transaction network;transactional data analytics;Ethereum blockchain network;smart contracts;supervised context;unsupervised context;anomaly detection","","3","","24","IEEE","26 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, we propose a transfer learning method based on Efficientnet to detect the encrypted malicious traffic.

Among all security threats, the hardware trojan (HT) inserted into the integrated circuit is one of the most concerns. As a flexible and nondestructive approach, the side-channel analysis techniques are widely used for HT detection. However, noise sensitivity and golden chip dependence make side-channel based approaches face greatly challenge in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel HT detection approach based on Isolation Forest, which provides high precision detection capability, while reducing the dependence of the golden chip. First, we perform special preprocessing, named Main Difference Accumulation (MDA), on the side-channel information to magnify the impacts of HT. Then, we train the isolation forest model using the processed information. During the test phase, the obtained model can score the test data. Finally, we complete the detection of HT based on the score and threshold. Moreover, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to achieve the automatic selection of the threshold in the isolation forest. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, we select the power signal as the side-channel information and insert four different kinds of HTs into the AES-128 crypto core. Results obtained using a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA board show that the accuracy of HT detection can reach 100%, with a 1.13% relative area ratio of the original circuit.","","978-1-6654-0396-2","10.1109/BigDataSE50710.2020.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9343363","hardware trojan detection;side-channel analysis (SCA);Isolation Forest (iForest)","Training;Sensitivity;Power demand;Clustering algorithms;Forestry;Hardware;Trojan horses","cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA board;AES-128 crypto core;automatic threshold selection;K-means clustering algorithm;noise sensitivity;golden chip dependence;HT detection approach;main difference accumulation;hardware security;isolation forest-based detection method;machine learning;hardware trojan detection;isolation forest model;side-channel information;high precision detection capability;side-channel based approaches;side-channel analysis techniques;nondestructive approach;flexible approach;security threats;global industry chain;integrated circuit design","","2","","18","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is because of the massive usage of end-to-end security protocols over Internet such as HTTPS and QUIC. The encryption trend will continue to rapidly increase in the future, and this trend concerns video streaming applications as well. Network providers face a serious challenge in managing their networks due to such widespread deployment of end-to-end security protocols. These operators need to have a clear visibility into traffic on their networks to monitor and manage both quality of experience (QoE)-and-service (QoS) impairments in popular video streaming services, in the most effective and efficient manner. Moreover, so many factors that influence QoE need to be taken care of to get an acceptable user experience. Most of the existing solutions use the deep packet inspection to infer these factors from the encrypted traffic. However, these solutions are inefficient, most of the time, leading to low QoE inference accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine-learning based solution that leverages a random forest classifier for a better QoE inference accuracy. The proposed solution uses network-and-transport layer information to infer QoE factors such as startup delay and stall events. It helps the network providers to react quickly and in real time for any impairments in the QoE of the encrypted video traffic. We evaluate our solution using an HTTP adaptive streaming service (YouTube) that uses HTTPS and QUIC protocols. Our experimental results show that our solution achieves up to 91.1% classification accuracy for HTTPS and up to 87.3% for QUIC.","2376-6506","978-1-7281-3129-0","10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148208","QoE;HTTP adaptive streaming;Encrypted video traffic;Classification accuracy;inferring QoE;Machine learning;Random Forest","Quality of experience;Streaming media;Bit rate;Monitoring;Encryption;Delays","computer network security;cryptography;hypermedia;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;quality of service;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming","inferring quality;adaptive video streaming;HTTPS;Internet traffic encryption;privacy;security concerns;end-to-end security protocols;encryption trend;video streaming applications;network providers;popular video streaming services;influence QoE;acceptable user experience;encrypted traffic;low QoE inference accuracy;machine-learning based solution;QUIC protocols;HTTP adaptive streaming service;encrypted video traffic;QoE factors;-transport layer information","","1","","25","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Constant memory features are extracted from the encrypted network traffic in these three windows in a stream-based fashion, and fed into a random forest model, which predicts whether the current time slot contains stalling or not. The presented system can predict stalling with a very high accuracy and the finest granularity to date (1s), and thus, can be used in networks for real-time QoE analysis from encrypted YouTube video streaming traffic.

Recent advances in deep learning have enabled not only the classification of encrypted transits, but classification on a per-packet level. End-to-end deep learning models are becoming increasingly ubiq-uitous given their ease of use, i.e., developers do not need to engineer features, and their apparent versatility. However, deep learning entails black-box models that hinder the capability to debug and explain classifications. Moreover, the computational complexity of deep learning can incur unnecessary latency, which is problematic for real-time classification needs. In this paper, we propose a methodology to interpret black-box, deep learning-based encrypted network traffic classification models, with an attempt to understand the dominant features a classifier is focusing on for a given task. We evaluate our approach on state-of-the-art deep learning classification techniques for encrypted per-packet classification and demonstrate how interpretability can be used to debug and improve the training pipeline while significantly reducing the size of the deep learning model. We propose future directions toward optimizing model performance while maintaining explainability.","2639-5061","978-1-6654-8362-9","10.1109/MN55117.2022.9887744","DARPA(grant numbers:W911NF19C0058); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9887744","Encrypted Network Traffic Classification;Inter-pretable Machine Learning","Deep learning;Training;Computational modeling;Pipelines;Telecommunication traffic;Quality of service;Real-time systems","cryptography;deep learning (artificial intelligence);explanation;pattern classification;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","real-time classification needs;machine learning;network traffic analysis;black-box models;deep learning-based encrypted network traffic classification models;per-packet encrypted network traffic classification;explainability;computational complexity;quality of service management;trend monitoring;security","","","","25","IEEE","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This overview aims to fill this gap and provide newcomers with a broader perspective to inform future research on this topic, especially for the multi-model approach. We have examined over 70 carefully selected papers in this scope and discovered that multi-model federated learning is the most effective technique that could enhance the air quality index prediction result.

Hence, it is essential to implement security schemes and to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of electronic circuits. Toward this end, the concept of physically unclonable functions (PUFs) has been established at the beginning of the 21st century. However, most PUFs have eventually, at least partially, fallen short of their promises, which are unpredictability, unclonability, uniqueness, reproducibility, and tamper resilience. That is because most PUFs directly utilize the underlying microelectronics, but that intrinsic randomness can be limited and may thus be predicted, especially by machine learning. Optical PUFs, in contrast, are still considered as promising-they can derive strong, hard-to-predict randomness independently from microelectronics, by using some kind of “optical token.” Here, we propose a novel concept for plasmonics-enhanced optical PUFs, or peo-PUFs in short. For the first time, we leverage two highly nonlinear phenomena in conjunction by construction: first, light propagation in a silicon disk resonator, and second, surface plasmons arising from nanoparticles arranged randomly on top of the resonator. We elaborate on the physical phenomena, provide simulation results, and conduct a security analysis of peo-PUFs for secure key generation and authentication. This study highlights the good potential of peo-PUFs, and our future work is to focus on fabrication and characterization of such PUFs.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2019.2920949","Center for Cyber Security at NYUAD/NYU; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731637","Hardware security;optical waveguide;physically unclonable function;plasmonics;silicon disc resonator","Optical sensors;Nonlinear optics;Optical resonators;Resonators;Optical device fabrication;Optical scattering;Silicon","cryptography;fraud;integrated optics;light propagation;nanoparticles;nanophotonics;nonlinear optics;optical resonators;plasmonics;silicon;surface plasmons","nanoparticles;light propagation;highly nonlinear phenomena;hard-to-predict randomness;optical token;plasmonics-enhanced optical PUF;machine learning;tamper resilience;microelectronics;physically unclonable functions;intrinsic randomness;unclonability;electronic circuits;trustworthiness;reliability;security schemes;identity fraud;data theft;omnipresent digitalization trend;plasmonics-enhanced silicon disc resonators;authentication;secure key generation;physical phenomena;surface plasmons;silicon disk resonator","","11","","41","IEEE","5 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, we have conducted a security analysis of the multi-party computing technology in the blockchain, and believe that these three technologies can well solve the privacy protection problem in the blockchain. Finally, we look forward to the development trend of the secure multi-party computing in the blockchain, which is expected to solve the problems of poor scalability, key distribution, and non-resistance to quantum attacks.

These malware infect the nodes in order to exploit their computational resources for specific purposes such as mining crypto-currency, cloud computing, etc. We suppose that each virus spreads following the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) compartmental model. Additionally, we assume that the malware designers can tune the percentage of resource utilization from their host nodes. A higher resource utilization implies a higher instantaneous profit but will also lead to faster detection and elimination (node recovery) of the malware. Once the malware is detected, complete protection of the infected node by means of anti-malware software is also possible at a smaller rate. The proposed setup results in a non-cooperative game between the two players (the malware designers) trying to maximize their profit i.e., the resources utilized from the infected nodes. We characterize and analyze the Nash equilibrium for such a game using a time-scale separation approximation. Finally, we numerically validate the approximation and we compute the price of anarchy.","2475-1456","","10.1109/LCSYS.2022.3186620","ANR(grant numbers:NICETWEET ANR-20-CE48-0009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9807350","Computer networks;game theory;compartmental models","Malware;Games;Computational modeling;Resource management;Viruses (medical);Computer viruses;Statistics","cloud computing;computer viruses;game theory;resource allocation","digital nodes;computational resources;mining crypto-currency;cloud computing;susceptible-infected-susceptible compartmental model;host nodes;infected node;anti-malware software;two competing malware;noncooperative resource utilization game;SIS;Nash equilibrium;time-scale separation approximation","","","","14","IEEE","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
