Being an emerging domain, the blockchain systems on which these cryptocurrencies are based, are a great source of investment among enthusiasts. However, there is high volatility in the price of Bitcoin and thus it paves the way for its prediction so as to get a clear insight on its trend. Forecasting Bitcoin prices can provide valuable insights for investment portfolio management, risk assessment, and the identification of profitable trading or arbitrage opportunities. Furthermore, Bitcoin price predictions may assist firms that accept Bitcoin payments in enhancing their financial management practices by improving their revenue and cash flow forecasting. Additionally, governmental entities and regulatory bodies could leverage Bitcoin price forecasting as a tool for monitoring and regulating the cryptocurrency industry.

This study aims to present a comparative performance of large-scale selected Machine Learning algorithms for cryptocurrency forecasting. Specifically, this paper concentrates on forecasting time series data for a short-term trading period in ten cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, XRP, DOGE, LUNA, LINK, LTC, and BCH) with ten selected machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Bayesian Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine). Our experiment results show that the Gradient Boosting with the mean square error criterion is superior in predicting most major cryptocurrencies by performing statistical analysis and data visualizations. Additionally, the Random Forest and Decision Tree model built by the Classification and Regression Tree algorithm also shows outstanding performance in certain currencies such as ETH, XRP, LUNA, and LTC.

This exponential growth relies mostly on the extreme volatility of the market, which led many people to become interested and get involved, primarily for profit. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts tend to share and learn news and opinions on social media platforms, one of the most popular being Twitter. In this paper, we study the extent to which Twitter sentiment analysis can be used to predict price fluctuations for cryptocurrencies. Initially, we gathered tweets and price data of seven of the most popular cryptocurrencies, which were processed to perform sentiment analysis using Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER). The time-series stationarity was determined with Augmented Dicky Fuller (ADF) Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin (KPSS) tests and then Granger Causality testing took place. While price fluctuations seem to cause sentiment for Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP and Doge, predictability was found for Ethereum and Polkadot, based on a bullishness ratio. Finally, predictability of price returns is examined with Vector Autoregression (VAR) and highly accurate forecasts for two of the seven cryptocurrencies were achieved. More specifically, price forecasts of Ethereum’s and Polkadot’s prices reached 99.67% and 99.17% accuracy, respectively.","","978-1-6654-6390-4","10.1109/IISA56318.2022.9904351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9904351","Cryptocurrency;Forecasting;Prediction;Sentiment Analysis;Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER);Augmented Dicky Fuller (ADF);Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin (KPSS);Granger Causality test;Vector Autoregression (VAR);Bullishness","Sentiment analysis;Reactive power;Fluctuations;Dictionaries;Social networking (online);Blogs;Bitcoin","autoregressive processes;cryptocurrencies;economic forecasting;financial data processing;sentiment analysis;share prices;social networking (online);stock markets;time series","cryptocurrency price prediction;social media sentiment analysis;Bitcoin;Twitter sentiment analysis;price fluctuation prediction;price data;time-series stationarity;Granger Causality testing;Polkadot;Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym;tweet data;price forecasting;Ethereum;price return predictability;augmented Dicky Fuller-Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin tests;valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning;ADF-KPSS tests;Cardano;XRP;Doge;vector autoregression;market volatility","","1","","33","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each news headline related to Bitcoin and Ethereum within the duration of one year is first manually annotated and then aggregated on a daily basis to generate the sentiment features. A Bi-GRU deep learning model is implemented to predict the cryptocurrency closing price of the next day given a combination of historical price and sentiment features of the current day. Our findings evidently show sentiment features when combined with the closing price of the current day contribute significantly to improve the model's performance.

To keep a cryptographic system safe against a quantum adversary, we must develop approaches based on a hard mathematical problem that is not vulnerable to quantum computer attacks, and we must develop Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

This has led to the creation of numerous brands of cryptocurrencies. It was only after the boom in their price in 2011 that they began to be regarded as an investment asset. Since these coins are highly volatile in their pricing, there is a need for a good prediction of their closing price on which investment decisions can be made. To address this requirement, this paper studies the relative performances of different machine learning algorithms for a well-known cryptocurrency - the ‘Bitcoin’. The performance measures of different machine learning models were undertaken to get the accuracy of the models for Bitcoin and results were obtained. The results show that the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is better than the other models and has the least mean absolute error. It is observed that the quality of training data and amount of the dataset used plays an important role for a successful prediction.

The computational hardness is the fundamental basis of the security of these keys. However, in the era of quantum computing, quantum computers can break down these keys with their substantially more computation capability than normal computers. For instance, a quantum computer can easily break down RSA or ECC in polynomial time. In order to make the keys quantum resistant, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is developed to enforce security of the classical cryptographic keys from the attack of quantum computers. By using quantum mechanics, QKD can reinforce the durability of the keys of classical cryptography, which were practically unbreakable during the pre-quantum era. Thus, an extensive study is required to understand the importance of QKD to make the classical cryptographic key distributions secure against both classical and quantum computers. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss trends and limitations of key management protocols in classical cryptography, and demonstrates a relative study of different QKD protocols. In addition, we highlight the security implementation aspects of QKD, which lead to the solution of threats occurring in a quantum computing scenario, such that the cryptographic keys can be quantum resistant.","","978-1-7281-8595-8","10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579624","Key distribution;Classical cryptography;Quantum cryptography;QKD;Quantum computing","Computers;Resistance;Technological innovation;Quantum computing;Protocols;Market research;Hardware","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;quantum computing;quantum cryptography","quantum computer;Quantum Key Distribution;QKD protocols;classical cryptographic keys;quantum mechanics;classical cryptography;pre-quantum era;classical cryptographic key distributions;key management protocols;quantum computing scenario;Quantum resistance;computational hardness;computation capability;RSA;QKD;elliptic curve cryptography;Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptography","","","","63","IEEE","3 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation.

Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to IoT devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like IoT applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term IoT device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat.

This paper selects 27 factors related to Bitcoin price changes and screens the features through the XGBoost algorithm and the Random Forest algorithm (RF). In this study, combined forecasting models based on Support Vector Regression (SVR), Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) and Twin Support Vector Regression (TWSVR) are used to predict Bitcoin price, separately. In addition, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are applied for parameter tuning of the models. Expected Variance Score (EVS), Coefficient of Determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to measure the prediction accuracy of the combined models. The CPU time is used to measure the operation speed of the combined models. The experimental results show that the combined model XGBoost-WOA-TWSVR has the best prediction effect, and the EVS score of this model is 0.9547.

The price of Bitcoin has gone through several cycles of highs and lows. As a result, it is a widely discussed topic, especially on platforms like Twitter. Sentiment analysis is a research area of Natural Language Processing. It is used to determine whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. Twitter tweets are more challenging to analyze when compared to other forms of text, due to the presence of irregular grammar, emoticons, and sarcasm. This study intends to analyze the effect of tweets on the stock price of Bitcoin. In order to study the effect, the sentiment associated with each tweet is calculated using VADER, and also the profession and follower count associated with verified users who tweet about bitcoin is found. Following this, a model is trained and tested using a combined dataset of tweet related data and historical bitcoin price data. It was found that the sentiment of tweets does correlate with the shift in the price of bitcoin.","","978-1-6654-6487-1","10.1109/ICSMDI57622.2023.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127661","Bitcoin;Sentiment Analysis;Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner;Twitter;Linear regression","Sentiment analysis;Dictionaries;Social networking (online);Blogs;Bitcoin;Data models;Grammar","cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;natural language processing;pricing;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","bitcoin price prediction;historical bitcoin price data;Natural Language Processing;stock price;tweet related data;Twitter sentiment analysis;Twitter tweets;widely discussed topic","","","","15","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is very difficult to anticipate because of the substantial volatility of the Bitcoin conversion scale. Forecasting of its behavior is crucial for the financial industry sectors. Some of the research works have been used machine learning techniques on past trends data of Bitcoin for its price predictions but they lack in accuracy. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to look into the global crypto-currency price movement trends about social media communication data as well as historical data trends. The thought is to analyze informative trends in online groups and social media networks to fully understand and extract useful information which could be used to improve the prediction accuracy of cryptocurrency price fluctuations. In this work we examine the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM and GRU, ARIMA model, Random forests(RF), and others for price direction predictions. Similarly, the SVM and ANN are used to predict Bitcoin’s minimum, maximum, and closing prices. The outcomes of the forecasts are also utilized as inputs to improve forecasts of price movement.

As a result of using blockchain technology, which decentralizes banking, daily cryptocurrency trading has become quite popular among observers, investors, customers, and many other groups. However, due to the daily fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies, prediction techniques enable stakeholders to look into the future and identify potential threats to their crucial investment operations. The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies has made price predictions more promising for investors along with researchers. As artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced to such a level, forecasting the price of cryptocurrencies has grown in significance. In this study, we develop an approach based on machine learning and deep learning as a form of AI to forecast the price of various cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BinanceCoin (BNB), and FTX (FTT), based on their various pricing points. The results from the machine learning models demonstrated that linear regression performed better in forecasting all types of cryptocurrency, with a maximum R2 score of 0.9477, 0.9232, 0.9204, and 0.8925 for BTC, ETH, BNB, and FTT, respectively. However, our study found that the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a deep learning-based model, was the most effective algorithm for predicting the prices of all four types of cryptocurrencies. With GRU, we were able to predict the price of ETH with an R2 score as high as 0.9983, and we were also able to predict the prices of BTC, BNB, and FTT with R2 scores of 0.9969, 0.9772, and 0.9873, respectively.

In the past two years, i.e., 2020 and 2021, the value of global currencies have been falling due to the poor run of stock markets. So the investors found it very hard to cope with the economical issues. This in turn has led to a renewal of interest in digital currency.

However, because this financial sector is already known for its extreme volatility and quick price changes, over brief periods of time. For such constantly changing nature of crypto trends and price, it has become a necessary part for traders and crypto enthusiast to get a detailed analysis before investing. Also, the construction of a precise and dependable forecasting model is regarded vital for portfolio management and optimization. In this paper we propose a web system, which will help to understand cryptocurrency in a more statistical way. Proposed system focuses mainly on four coins : Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu performing analysis and forecasting on all the four coins. System will also do statistical comparison between the coins. Analysis and comparison is carried out using python libraries and modules whereas LSTM and ARIMA are used for forecasting. Extensive research was conducted using real-time and historical information, on four key cryptocurrencies, two of which had the greatest market capitalization, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, while the other, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, that had a significant growth in market capitalization over the previous year. In comparison to old fully-connected deep neural networks, the suggested model may employ mixed crypto data more proficiently, minimizing overfitting and computing costs.","","978-1-6654-6851-0","10.1109/ASIANCON55314.2022.9909168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9909168","LSTM(Long short-term memory);ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average);Real time data;historical data;BTC;ETH;Dogecoin;Shiba;prediction;analysis","Technological innovation;Neural networks;Bitcoin;Predictive models;Market research;Real-time systems;Libraries","autoregressive moving average processes;cryptocurrencies;economic forecasting;financial data processing;forecasting theory;investment;optimisation;pricing;recurrent neural nets","ARIMA;Bitcoin;crypto price;crypto trends;cryptocurrency forecasting;cryptocurrency analysis;cryptocurrency trading;Dogecoin;Ethereum;forecasting model;historical information;LSTM;lucrative investments;mixed crypto data;monetary businesses;portfolio management;Python libraries;real-time information;Shiba Inu;Web system","","1","","23","IEEE","11 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we introduce KryptoOracle, a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation. Overall, the proposed platform can help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume and variety.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006554","cryptocurrency;price prediction;software platform;real time;Spark;social media;sentiment analysis;machine learning","Real-time systems;Bitcoin;Social network services;Predictive models;Sparks;Machine learning","cryptocurrencies;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","real-time cryptocurrency price prediction platform;Twitter sentiments;exchange medium;financial transaction;asset transfer verification;real-time price prediction;massive heterogeneous data volumes;social media sentiments;fault tolerance;sentiment data;Spark-based architecture;sentiment analysis;KryptoOracle platform;financial data volume","","17","","24","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), which show high performance in time-series data, are mainly used for this approach. Further, studies adopting the second approach recommend actions to investors to maximize profits, such as “Sell”, “Buy”, and “Wait.” In this approach, classification models are used and results are derived based on probabilities. However, these action recommendation models do not consider the quality of the result. For example, it is risky to accept the result when the probability that the result of the action recommendation model for two classes is the correct answer is approximately 51%. To solve this problem, we recommend a method for adjusting the result of the action recommendation model based on Twitter sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed adjustment method improves the performance by approximately 3% compared to the conventional methods and are statistically validated.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3273898","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2023R1A2C1008134); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10121187","Cryptocurrency;Bitcoin;Bitcoin action recommendation;deep learning;sentiment analysis;profit maximization","Cryptocurrency;Predictive models;Social networking (online);Blogs;Sentiment analysis;Analytical models;Data models","cryptocurrencies;deep learning (artificial intelligence);financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pricing;profitability;recommender systems;recurrent neural nets;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);time series","classification models;cryptocurrencies;cryptocurrency action recommendation model;deep learning-based price prediction models;future cryptocurrency price;profit maximization;research approaches;sentiment analysis-based adjustment;Twitter sentiment analysis","","1","","50","CCBYNCND","8 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To test their approach, the authors transformed pixels or RGB values from digital images into text, which was then fed into the Huffman Coding Technique. It has the advantage of compressing the entire text, which makes it faster to transmit vast amounts of information.

This study constructs time-series models to examine DeFi- and NFT-related cryptocurrencies and to clarify how their weekly prices fluctuated over a one-year period. Using Google Trends data, we measure how weekly Internet searches into crypto markets generally and specific branded cryptocurrencies affected price fluctuations for each coin. Results show that Bitcoin prices modeled as an exogenous variable have a positive effect on Ethereum prices. On average, brand-specific and market-level Google searches were estimated to be negative but not statistically convincing for DeFi- and NFT-branded altcoins.","2375-9259","978-1-6654-2427-1","10.1109/ICDMW53433.2021.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679887","cryptocurrency;DeFi and NFT;Google Trends;time-series analysis;dynamic linear model","Fluctuations;Social networking (online);Time series analysis;Finance;Bitcoin;Market research;Explosives","cryptocurrencies;data privacy;financial data processing;Internet;pricing;search engines;time series","time-series analysis;cryptocurrency prices;Decentralized Finance;NonFungible Tokens;blockchain technology;DeFi;crypto-assets;cryptocurrency markets;NFT-branded altcoins;time-series models;weekly prices;Google Trends data;weekly Internet searches;specific branded cryptocurrencies;price fluctuations;Bitcoin prices;Ethereum prices;market-level Google searches","","","","15","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this paper is to develop a novel decomposition-ensemble learning model that combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) with machine learning algorithms to forecast the Bitcoin price multi-step ahead. The algorithms are k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel, Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with single-layer perceptron, Generalized Linear Model, and Cubist. Correlation matrix (CORR), principal component analysis (PCA), and Box-Cox transformation (BOXCOX) were used as data preprocessing techniques. Estimating the performance of the proposed models (namely VMD-STACK-CORR, VMD-STACK-PCA, and VMD-STACK-BOXCOX) using relative root mean square error, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and absolute percentage error measures, defined that for one-day-ahead forecast VMD-STAK-BOXCOX model presented the better performance, and for two and three-days-ahead forecast VMD-STACK-CORR model was chosen, compared to VMD, STACK, and machine learning algorithms models' performance. Diebold-Mariano statistical test was conducted to evaluate a reduction in forecasting errors.

However, Dash coin is an individual cryptocurrency, but it is derived from Bitcoin and Litecoin. The change in Bitcoin and Litecoin prices affects the Dash coin price. Motivated from these, we present a cryptocurrency price prediction framework in this paper. It acknowledges different cryptographic forms of money (which are subject to one another) as information and yields higher accuracy. To illustrate this concept, we have considered a price prediction of Dash coin through the past days’ prices of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin as they have hierarchical dependency among them at the protocol level.

Since the introduction of machine learning and increased computer power, programmable forecasting approaches have been found to be particularly effective in predicting stock values. Random Decision Forest, K - Nearest Neighbors, and Linear Regression were among the natural processing techniques employed in this study to forecast the costs of popular crypto currencies like Bit coin and Ethereum over the next few years. The model is given financial data on stock prices from the start of the day to the end of the day. Bitcoin's value may or may not improve in the future because it has been on the market for a decade. Ethereum was created in 2015 and is now the second most popular crypto currency on the market. The value of Ethereum is nearly comparable to that of Bit coin. After a few years, it is doubtful whether bit coin will be available on the market. As a result, buyers seek forecasts in order to invest in the right crypto currency and profit from it. The user can use this forecast to anticipate the future of both crypto currency prices. To assess the value of crypto currencies, we used three forecasted analytic techniques, and we can compare the accuracy of the three algorithms to see which one is the best.","","978-1-6654-9707-7","10.1109/ICIRCA54612.2022.9985532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9985532","Random Decision Forest;K nearest Neighbor;Linear Regression;Pandas;NumPy;Matplotlib;Seaborn;Machine Learning;Ethereum;Bitcoin","Machine learning algorithms;Uncertainty;Linear regression;Bitcoin;Forestry;Machine learning;Prediction algorithms","financial data processing;forecasting theory;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);pricing;profitability;regression analysis;stock markets","bit coin;bitcoin;crypto currencies;crypto currency prices;economic goods market recoveries;Ethereum;financial data;forecasted analytic techniques;increased computer power;investors;Linear Regression;machine learning;natural processing techniques;Nearest Neighbors;popular crypto currency;professional strategy;profit;programmable forecasting approaches;Random Decision Forest;stock prices;stock values;uncertainty;volatility","","","","23","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Randomly selected data to train the model, may cause inappropriate results and reduce the accuracy of price prediction. In this paper, we investigate a proper data selection method to train a prediction model. We apply our proposed methodology to train a simple linear regression prediction algorithm. We predict bitcoin price for 7 days with the linear regression model. When we train the linear regression model with an appropriate data chunk identified by our methodologies, we find acceptable results for the prediction.

Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, etc. The value of each cryptocurrency keeps varying from time to time. In this research paper, we build a data analytics model of the various cryptocurrency and also a machine learning model using the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm to forecast the value of a certain cryptocurrency on a particular day. This paper uses a web application called Yahoo Finance(yfinance) which has all the details of the live stock market and this acts as a source of dataset for this paper. Also, various python packages such as numpy, pandas, tensorflow, seaborn, matplotlib, etc. are used for building a model. The LSTM algorithm makes use of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) which is powerful to model data sequencer because it has an internal memory state to store the past seen data.

While many people are making investments in Cryptocurrency, the dynamical features, uncertainty, the predictability of Cryptocurrency are still mostly unknown, which dramatically risk the investments. It is a matter to try to understand the factors that infiuence the value formation. In this study, we use advanced artificial intelligence frameworks of fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to analyse the price dynamics of Bitcoin, Etherum, and Ripple. We find that ANN tends to rely more on long-term history while LSTM tends to rely more on short-term dynamics, which indicate the efficiency of LSTM to utilise useful information hidden in historical memory is stronger than ANN. However, given enough historical information ANN can achieve a similar accuracy, compared with LSTM. This study provides a unique demonstration that Cryptocurrency market price is predictable. However, the explanation of the predictability could vary depending on the nature of the involved machine-learning model.","","978-1-7281-3430-7","10.1109/INFOMAN.2019.8714700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8714700","ANN;LSTM;Cryptocurrency price prediction;neural network","Bitcoin;Predictive models;History;Artificial neural networks;Logic gates;Time series analysis","cryptocurrencies;learning (artificial intelligence);pricing;recurrent neural nets","historical information ANN;LSTM;financial system;investments;artificial intelligence frameworks;fully connected artificial neural network;long short-term memory recurrent neural network;cryptocurrency market price;cryptocurrency price analysis","","26","","12","IEEE","16 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Asset pricing is a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders. Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model, we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206704","Market Stock Prediction;Bitcoin (BTC);Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX);Recurrent Neural Network (RNN);Sentiment Analysis","Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Bitcoin;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Twitter","autoregressive moving average processes;crowdsourcing;cryptocurrencies;feature extraction;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;sentiment analysis;share prices;stock markets;time series","asset pricing;Bitcoin price trend;deep learning;Bitcoin market stocks;recurrent neural network;sentiment feature;Bitcoin time series predictions;sentiment driven price prediction;crowdsourced data;cryptocurrency;financial feature extraction;sentiment feature extraction;autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous input;ARIMAX","","14","","34","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cryptocurrency market performs similarly to other financial markets with considerable nonlinearity and volatility and its prediction is a growing research area. It is challenging to capture the inherent uncertainties connected with cryptocurrency using the currently used conventional methodologies. The popularity of random vector functional link networks (RVFLN) is attributed to its simple structural layout, quick rate of learning, and enhanced generalization ability. It computes the output layer weights using non-iterative techniques like least square methods or iterative techniques like gradient methods, and assigns hidden neuron parameters at random. Random initialization of non-optimal hidden neuron settings, however, degrades the performance. Population-based metaheuristics are a superior option to random initialization for determining the ideal parameters and avoiding the problem of local optima stagnation. In the current article, an elitist artificial electric field algorithm (eAEFA) for training RVFLN is proposed. Here, eAEFA is utilized to create an ideal RVFLN by determining the weights and biases of the hidden layer connections. The elitism method is used by AEFA to maximize its strength. Here, the most suitable entities are directly inserted to create the population of the following generation. By predicting the closing values of six widely used cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, ZEC, XLM, and Ripple, one may determine how well the eAEFA+RVFLN model is performing. For comparison study, models including ARIMA, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), basic RVFLN, support vector regression (SVR), LSTM, GA trained RVFLN, and AEFA trained RVFLN are also constructed concurrently. In terms of performance and statistical significance testing, the suggested eAEFA+RVFLN findings outperform the comparator models. On an average, it achieves a MAPE (mean absolute percentage of error) value of 0.0573, R2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.9589, POCID (prediction of change in direction) of 0.9676, RMSE (root mean squared error) of 0.0685, MAE (mean absolute error) of 0.0727 and an average rank of 1.346; as a result, it is possible to recommend it as a useful financial forecasting tool.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3283571","Yonsei Fellow Program funded by Lee Youn Jae, Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korean government, Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(grant numbers:2020-0-01361); Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program (Yonsei University)(grant numbers:2022-0-00113); Developing a Sustainable Collaborative Multi-modal Lifelong Learning Framework).

To check the efficiency of these models we made out-of-sample forecast for three cryptocurrencies by using one step ahead technique. As the accuracy rate for our models we were selected Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics.

Volatility measures the variation of a time series data, and thus it is also a driving factor for the risk forecasting of returns from investment in cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is a decentralized medium of exchange that relies on cryptographic primitives to facilitate the trustless transfer of value between different parties. Instead of being physical money, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries on an online ledger called blockchain that describe specific transactions.Many commonly used risk forecasting models do not take into account the uncertainty associated with the volatility of an underlying asset to obtain the risk forecasts. Some tools from the fuzzy set theory can be incorporated into the forecasting models to account for this uncertainty. Interest in the use of hybrid models for fuzzy volatility forecasts is growing. However, a major drawback is that the fuzzy coefficient hybrid models used in fuzzy volatility forecasts are not data-driven. This paper uses fuzzy set theory with data-driven volatility and data-driven neuro-volatility forecasts to study the fuzzy risk forecasts. The study focuses on long-term volatility forecasts with daily price data while briefly exploring forecasting models with high-frequency (hourly) data as an avenue for future research. Simple yet effective models incorporating fuzziness to obtain fuzzy risk volatility forecasts and fuzzy VaR forecasts are presented. The key underlying idea, unlike the existing risk forecasting, is the use of a hybrid nonlinear adaptive fuzzy model for volatility.","2640-7701","978-1-6654-4234-3","10.1109/CIFEr52523.2022.9776213","University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776213","Fuzzy risk forecasting;Asymteric Nonlinear Adaptive fuzzy number;Data-driven volatility","Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Robustness","cryptocurrencies;economic forecasting;finance;fuzzy set theory;investment;pricing;risk analysis;time series","fuzzy VaR forecasts;existing risk forecasting;hybrid nonlinear adaptive fuzzy model;fuzzy risk forecast intervals;data-driven volatility models;neuro-volatility models;time series data;cryptocurrency payments;commonly used risk forecasting models;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy volatility forecasts;fuzzy coefficient hybrid models;data-driven neuro-volatility forecasts;long-term volatility forecasts;daily price data;high-frequency data;fuzzy risk volatility forecasts","","","","29","IEEE","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time - rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16%.

Since investment on bitcoin is increasing day to day and the bitcoin price fluctuates frequently, traders need a way to predict its price in prior so that the risks associated with it can be reduced and capital gain can be improved. The various existing works on price prediction have low accuracy and predict short term price only. Due to the difficulty of determining the exact existence of a Time Series model, it is difficult to generate appropriate forecasts. The Proposed technique uses deep learning to predict bitcoin prices with Recurrent Neural Network model using the time series data to provide the better accuracy. The novelty of work is to obtain a long-term prediction, the recurrent neural network model is trained and tested on the available dataset. This work predicts the value of bitcoin for the year 2021.

Predicting changes in cryptocurrency price is a hugely important topic to investors and researchers, with much existing research on demand-side factors. The goal of this research project is to design and implement machine learning models to predict future cryptocurrency price change direction based primarily on supply-side factors. Different unsupervised machine learning techniques are used to build the predictive models. These techniques include K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayesian Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. A dataset of 10 daily supply-side metrics for three prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin) at four different time horizons (ranging from one day to 30 days) are used to build and test the machine learning models. The outputs of these models indicate the predicted direction of the price movement over the time horizon (i.e., whether the price would go up or down), not the magnitude of the movement. Experimental results show that predictions were very unreliable for the shorter time spans but very reliable for the longest time spans. The Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest classifiers consistently outperformed the other techniques and achieved a prediction accuracy of over 90% in most models and over 95% in the best models. Experimental results show also that there is no significant difference in predictability between the three prominent cryptocurrencies.","","978-1-6654-8453-4","10.1109/AIIoT54504.2022.9817249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817249","Machine learning;classification;cryptocurrency;Bitcoin;Ethereum;Litecoin","Support vector machines;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Distance measurement;Cryptocurrency;Reliability","cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;pattern classification;random forests;support vector machines;unsupervised learning","supply-side factors;machine learning methods;investors;demand-side factors;machine learning models;predictive models;support vector machines;naive Bayesian classifier;predicted direction;price movement;time horizon;artificial neural network;random forest classifiers;supply-side metrics;unsupervised machine learning techniques;cryptocurrency price change direction;Bitcoin;Ethereum;Litecoin","","","","10","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Predicting the price movement of crypto assets has a number of challenges, especially due to the high volatility of trading prices. Traditionally this process is carried out by conducting technical analysis using technical indicators which requires extensive knowledge and experience to get maximum profit in cryptocurrency trading. The CRISP-DM methodology was applied to create a classification model to predict the movement of the BTCUSDT cryptocurrency pair using a tree-based classification algorithm with the Gradient Boosting framework, namely the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). The Logistic Regression algorithm was used as a comparison. As input data, the klines dataset of the BTCUSDT cryptocurrency pair is used and feature engineering is carried out in the form of labelling (up/down) as well as a number of technical indicators commonly used in trading activities. The prediction results of the classification model are then used in the further evaluation stage by being tested (used for trading) against the original data of BTCUSDT price movements for one month and the Return on Investment (ROI) obtained is evaluated against the Buy and Hold strategy. Based on the evaluation results, the resulting model has a better performance than Logistic Regression, but the model's performance has not been able to exceed the ROI value of the Buy and Hold strategy consistently and still can't generate profit.","2470-640X","979-8-3503-1983-5","10.1109/ICSET57543.2022.10010808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10010808","LightGBM;cryptocurrency;technical analysis;machine learning;Gradient Boosting Classification","Predictive models;Boosting;Systems engineering and theory;Prediction algorithms;Data models;Cryptocurrency;Classification algorithms","cryptocurrencies;economic forecasting;investment;logistic regression;pattern classification;share prices;stock markets;supervised learning;trees (mathematics)","BTCUSDT cryptocurrency pair;BTCUSDT price movements;buy and hold strategy;CRISP-DM methodology;crypto assets;cryptocurrency trading;feature engineering;klines dataset;LGBM;light gradient boosting machine;LightGBM classification modeling;logistic regression;machine learning-based system;price movement prediction;return on investment;ROI;technical indicators;trading activities;trading prices;tree-based classification algorithm;volatility","","","","18","IEEE","17 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PIs are susceptible to monetary losses in the open market due to the aforementioned issues. The fraudsters could be both internal (operator of the scheme) and external (financial institutions (FI), such as banks, money-lenders, and insurance companies). The centrality of trust among stakeholders like PI, CF, and FI is a prime concern. Motivated from these facts, this paper proposes a decentralized framework, KaRuNa, A Blockchain-based Sentiment analysis framework for Fraud Cryptocurrency schemes. KaRuNa operates on public blockchain three phases of trust modeling among stakeholders. In the first phase, transactions are performed on the blockchain that offers trust, auditability, and transparency among stakeholders. In the second phase, sentiment analysis (SA) of cryptocurrencies is proposed based on a novel algorithm of hash addresses to generate classification scores (CS). Parameters like social trends, rise/fall in cryptocurrency price, measured standard deviation, peak and low are selected to fed to proposed novel Long-short term memory (LSTM) classifier to generate recommendations based on CS. An accuracy of 98.99% is achieved using LSTM over generated CS to evaluate risks in the investment.

To discover the relationship among different currencies, the concept of visual question answering (VQA) is applied in RNs. We also propose a specially designed architecture for the feature extraction stage to consider both spatial and temporal relationships simultaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve higher prediction performance for cryptocurrencies with approximately 65% accuracy rate.

Therefore the intelligent management and under-standing the characteristics of cryptocurrencies are becoming more interesting. The price of cryptocurrencies are characterized by linear and nonlinear trend, seasonality and high volatility, which increases the risk factors for investors. This study ex-periments with three different time series forecasting methods, specifically considered for Cryptocurrencies price such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR) and Cardano (XRP), and devises a procedure to evaluate their performance. Time series data are collected and examined using descriptive statistics. In next step, the White Neural Network is used for Non-Linearity and Dickey-Fuller for nonstationary and correlation among different settings of datasets. Based on these analyses, we evaluate efficient financial forecasting models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric, Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal (TBATS) and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) with reference to different parameters configuration of these models. The performance is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) criterion and models are ranked by statistical mean and standard deviation of MAPE values. The NNAR model gives minimum MAPE of 2.823 while the minimum convergence time of 4.9835s is observed with TBATS and hence, these are ranked at top amongst other models respectively. These results underpin that neural network-based models perform equally well on both types of nonlinear and linear financial data and, thus, have the potential to improve the impact of financial transaction and cryptocurrencies price bringing more innovation in the decision making process.","","978-1-6654-6837-4","10.1109/IICAIET55139.2022.9936798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9936798","ARIMA;NNAR;TBATS;Cryptocurrencies Forecasting;Bitcoin;Ethereum","Analytical models;Technological innovation;Correlation;Time series analysis;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Market research","autoregressive moving average processes;blockchains;cryptocurrencies;decision making;forecasting theory;investment;mean square error methods;neural nets;time series","minimum convergence time;TBATS;neural network-based models;cryptocurrencies price;blockchain-based cryptocurrencies;performance evaluation;ARIMA;investment purposes;intelligent management;high volatility;time series forecasting methods;time series data;descriptive statistics;nonlinearity;financial forecasting models;ARMA errors;neural network autoregressive;parameters configuration;root mean square error;mean absolute percentage error criterion;statistical mean;NNAR model;white neural network;autoregressive integrated moving average;standard deviation;decision making process","","","","29","IEEE","9 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crypto is the buzzword nowadays where people worldwide are investing their money in a digital payment transaction and have ticked all the boxes when it comes to cases such as security, seemingly fast transactions, and has quickly emerged as one the world's fastest-growing financial markets. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency launched in 2009 showcased the proof of work of a decentralised system and what blockchain is capable of doing in a digital ecosystem. Scope: Our paper aims at suggesting currencies to future investors based on the sentiments on popular social media and predicting the overall growth of any coin to analyze its growth prospects. Method: In this paper, we have attempted a meticulous approach to predict the price movements in cryptocurrencies considering its fluctuating factors. Since no unique model can predict the market changes effectively, we focussed on creating a SETP (Sentiment Evaluation for Trend Prediction) model, which analyzes the sentiment surrounding the crypto market and the apprehensions that engulf an investor while investing. The statistical data analysis of the top 5 coins in the market has been undertaken effectively using IBM Watson services. Further enhancements have been made using the jupyter notebook to predict the market highs of the top trending coins. The sentimental evaluation has been done by extracting Twitter trends and hashtags thereby judging the sentiments of the microblogging site and paving a way to predict the exact emotion of investors all over the globe. Findings: Finally, we believe that this research has immense capability to predict the market speculation using the various technologies that are still in the rudimentary phase and has a lot of potential in invoking the interest of researchers and providing useful data/cognizance for future investors.","","978-1-6654-3811-7","10.1109/ICAC3N53548.2021.9725704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9725704","Data Analysis;Sentiments;Prediction;Cryptocurrency;Machine Learning","Analytical models;Social networking (online);Mood;Blogs;Predictive models;Market research;Proof of Work","cryptocurrencies;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","digital payment transaction;financial markets;bitcoin;cryptocurrency;decentralised system;blockchain;digital ecosystem;social media;coin;price movements;fluctuating factors;unique model;market changes;Sentiment Evaluation for Trend Prediction;crypto market;statistical data analysis;IBM Watson services;trending coins;Twitter trends;market speculation;crypto currency portfolio allocation;machine learning;economic health patterns change;wealth preservation;buzzword;sentiment evaluation for trend prediction model;SETP","","2","","12","IEEE","9 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Twitter is a main source of information for many small-time investors because it is one of the most prominent social media venues for interactions and news. XGBoost has shown significant potential in tackling regression issues with limited datasets, such as weather and demand prediction. LSTM, on the other hand, is widely recognized as one of the best and most simple deep learning algorithms for forecasting problems. In this study, we examine and compare the LSTM model's base version with the XGBoost model for predicting Ether prices. These price forecasts are supported by sentiment analysis performed on Twitter data in the form of tweets, which are spam filtered using the C5.0 algorithm to decrease noise in the data.

It has become a tool for predicting future trends based on what is known beforehand. Like other financial stock markets, cryptocurrency has become a new sensation and challenge for investors to predict its behaviour. However, unlike other financial instruments, cryptocurrency has been renowned because of the difficulty to predict the price due to its volatility behaviour that changes so rapidly and since there is no fundamental economy for its value. This paper presents a performance comparison of two ML algorithms in predicting Ethereum price with non-time series analysis, which are k- Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and multiple polynomial regression (MPR). The experiment used independent variables from related real-world economic fundamentals such as Dow Jones Index, gold price, oil price, and Ethereum volume. The experiment data was collected from the records from April 2017 until April 2021. For each algorithm, several methods of preprocessing data were used to match all independent data with the dependent data. Three different preprocessing scenarios were also used to find the maximum accuracy model. scenario 1 (feature selection based on correlation matrix), scenario 2 (feature selection based on correlation with the dependent variables and among independent variables), and scenario 3 (scenario 1 extracted with PCA). The performance of the compared methods was evaluated by using MSE and MAE. From the experiment, a comparison of results using two different models with k-NN and multiple polynomial regression is obtained. It is found that k-NN with a hyperparameter K = 2 have the best prediction with MSE = 449.032 and MAE = 14.282 compared with multiple polynomial regression with the best MSE = 13953.96 and MAE = 84.923.","","978-1-6654-9696-4","10.1109/QIR54354.2021.9716169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716169","crypocurrency;k-NN;multiple polynomial regression","Gold;Correlation;Oils;Data preprocessing;Prediction algorithms;Feature extraction;Market research","economic forecasting;feature selection;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);nearest neighbour methods;pricing;principal component analysis;regression analysis;stock markets;time series","k-NN;multiple polynomial regression;real-world economic fundamentals;gold price;oil price;Ethereum volume;feature selection;Ethereum price prediction comparison;machine learning algorithms;future financial trends;financial stock markets;cryptocurrency;financial instruments;ML algorithms;nontime series analysis;PCA;Dow Jones Index","","","","16","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rise of deep learning recently, various researches on forecasting the price of cryptocurrency using deep neural network have reported encouraging results in the cases of low volatility. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach which combines the advantages of non-stationary parametric models such as Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) with the nonlinear modelling potential of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The results show that our hybrid model has a similar predictive performance in terms of MSE, MAE and RMSE but higher metric scores in precision, accuracy and F1 score under optimal hyperparameters. This study reveals that the combination of parametric models like GARCH with deep neural network may come up with better results in cryptocurrency price forecasting especially in the case of highly volatile data or when short data sequences are available. Moreover, the proposed framework can be used also in other applications where high volatility and scarcity of data are the main characteristics.","1551-2541","978-1-7281-6338-3","10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9596429","Non-stationary Time Series Analysis;Cryptocurrency Prediction;Bitcoin;Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM);GARCH","Deep learning;Analytical models;Time series analysis;Bitcoin;Predictive models;Signal processing;Feature extraction","autoregressive processes;cryptocurrencies;deep learning (artificial intelligence);financial data processing;mean square error methods;pricing;recurrent neural nets","bitcoin price prediction;deep learning;deep neural network;nonstationary parametric models;generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity;GARCH;nonlinear modelling;long short term memory neural networks;cryptocurrency price forecasting;hybrid model;LSTM;MAE;RMSE","","","","12","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government agencies resulting in prices being strongly influenced by public opinion. Understanding the relationship between cryptocurrency prices and the public sentiment can lead to improved predictions of price movement. In this paper, we give an exploratory analysis of a network of 24 Reddit communities related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies to analyze Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements. We engineer a set of 112 time series features from submissions and comments made on the selected subreddits, run Granger causality tests on engineered time series against cryptocurrency price movements, and use these time series to forecast the cryptocurrency price movements using classification models. Results from these models support the Granger causality test results showing that with only lagged price values and lagged values from a single Reddit data derived feature, the direction of Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements can be predicted with 74.2% and 73.1% accuracy respectively.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999092","Cryptocurrency, PageRank, time series analysis, Granger causality, sentiment analysis, Gradient Boosting Machines","Time series analysis;Bitcoin;Predictive models;Social network services;Sentiment analysis","causality;cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;pricing;social networking (online);time series","Bitcoin;cryptocurrencies;Ethereum price movements;cryptocurrency price movements;Reddit network sentiment;Granger causality;time series features;public sentiment;classification models","","1","","27","IEEE","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following this trend, this work presents a novel implementation of a High-performance Polynomial Multiplication hardware Accelerator for NTRU (HPMA-NTRU) under different parameter settings, one of the lattice-based PQC algorithm that is currently under the consideration by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization process. In total, we have carried out three layers of efforts to obtain the proposed work. First of all, we have proposed a new schoolbook algorithm based strategy to derive the desired polynomial multiplication algorithm for NTRU. Then, we have mapped the algorithm to build a high-performance polynomial multiplication hardware accelerator and have extended this hardware accelerator to different parameter settings with proper adjustment. Finally, through a series of complexity analysis and implementation based comparison, we have shown that the proposed hardware accelerator obtains better area-time complexities than the state-of-the-art one.

Fuzzy set theory has a unique ability to quantitatively and qualitatively model and analyze such problems. Volatility forecasting plays an important role in financial risk management and in option pricing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in data-driven volatility models and neurovolatility models for risk forecasting of stocks and index funds. However, even these state-of-the-art models do not take into account the fuzzy volatility in their risk forecasts.Cryptocurrencies are a novel financial asset class based on the Blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity among retail investors as a financial asset with high risks and high returns. The extremely volatile nature of cryptocurrencies (compared to traditional assets) makes forecasting their volatility more challenging. A simple algorithmic trading approach, Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy, is used to calculate the Algo returns. This paper provides fuzzy forecasts of the volatility of Algo returns using the data-driven Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (DD-EWMA) and neuro models for six major cryptocurrencies. We also compute and compare fuzzy volatility forecasts of four major tech stocks and Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) volatility index (VIX) using DD-EWMA and neuro models.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Quantum computers require a classical – i.e., non-quantum – electronic interface to drive quantum operations on quantum bits (qubits), and to read out their quantum state. As quantum processors scale up to comprise more and more cryogenic qubits, the availability of a cryogenic electronic controller is crucial to support such scaling by avoiding the many unreliable and bulky interconnects connecting the cryogenic devices to room-temperature controllers. In this talk, we will review the latest advances in cryo-CMOS electronics for quantum-computing applications, both by TU Delft and other academic and industrial researchers, so as to identify the current trends and the needs still to be addressed. In particular, we will focus on the progress in the development of the individual high-performance circuit blocks (ADC, PLL, LNA,…) and in the trend to integrate qubit drivers, readouts, and biasing in largescale SoCs. By addressing the unsolved issues in this rapidly growing research field, we will outline the path towards the future comprehensive cryo-CMOS electronic interfaces that will enable largescale quantum computers.","1930-8868","978-1-6654-0923-0","10.1109/VLSI-TSA54299.2022.9770986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9770986","","Qubit;Market research;Cryogenics;Computers;Very large scale integration;Vehicles;Roads","cryogenic electronics;cryogenics;cryptographic protocols;quantum computing;quantum cryptography;readout electronics;system-on-chip","quantum computing;largescale quantum computers;future comprehensive cryo-CMOS electronic interfaces;qubit drivers;quantum-computing applications;cryo-CMOS electronics;room-temperature controllers;cryogenic devices;bulky interconnects;unreliable interconnects;cryogenic electronic controller;cryogenic qubits;quantum processors scale;quantum state;quantum bits;quantum operations;electronic interface;conference proceedings;complete presentation;summary form","","","","","IEEE","10 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the usages of blockchain is in digital currencies. Digital currency (cryptocurrency) is a new era for the global financial system. Cryptocurrencies draw significant attention from researchers because of their advantages. Although there are several risks (e.g., speculation, 51% attack) related to cryptocurrency, billions of dollars are invested in them, because of their transparency, traceability, low transaction cost, and highly profitable potential. In December 2017, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached almost $20,000.00 per coin. Such short-term, high gain potential attracts many new small investors. However, speculative movements raise many questions related to the safety and privacy of investors, just to name a few. To understand public opinions about cryptocurrency and speculative movements to protect small investors financial interests, sentiment analysis can be done by using social media activities of individuals who are interested or investing in cryptocurrencies. It is also one of the essential steps in the analysis to understand the profiles of the users. Therefore, in this paper, we determine the attitudes of social network users by analyzing the positivity and negativity of the comments about six cryptocurrencies. Results show that the positivity is higher than negativity, and there exist relations between price changes and attitudes. However, relations vary according to currency types. The results and analysis, which are provided in this paper, help new investors and developers to obtain opinions of social network users who are interested or investing in cryptocurrency.","2325-2626","978-1-7281-4905-9","10.1109/ICNC47757.2020.9049693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9049693","Cryptocurrency;Social Media;Attitude Analysis;Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment analysis;Privacy;Costs;Social networking (online);Online banking;Bitcoin;Position measurement","cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;investment;pricing;social networking (online)","investors;speculative movements;social network users;social media users;digital currency;cryptocurrency;negative comments","","6","","27","IEEE","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The price of Bitcoin vary over time and is governed by various factors, like the market it is being traded in, scarcity, supply and demand. What has made Bitcoin valuable is that it can be used as a currency, we can pay a part or a fraction of Bitcoin to a person in exchange for something and the part is easily verifiable by blockchain. The small number of Bitcoin, roughly 16 million Bitcoins for the entire world has made it scare and above that its high utility makes it more prestigious.Trading of Bitcoin has proved to be very profitable to many people but the risk in trading is huge as the market of Bitcoin is very volatile. To decrease the risks, this project has been carried out to predict the price of Bitcoin using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Linear Regression(LR) to predict the price of Bitcoin. Evaluation of these algorithms is carried out to determine which among the two is better for the prediction of Bitcoin prices.

The daily cryptocurrency price data of Bitcoin (BTC) is collected from a freely available website (cryptocompare.com). For the prediction of BTC/USD price, we considered the average values of daily opening, high, low and closing price as OHLC value. The data set is denoised from white noise using the discrete wavelet transform method (DWT) by VisuShrink thresholding on Daubechies (db4) wavelet at level=5. OHLC and denoised OHLC (DOHLC) values are predicted using ARIMA(p,d,q) and LSTM methods. LSTM hyperparameters are evaluated using 28 different combinations. A pair of Adam-linear optimization and activation function is the best hyperparameter with the lowest mean loss value of 1.42e-03.

Protein folding has been one of the most interesting areas to study, and it is also one of the biggest problems of biochemistry. Each protein folds distinctively, and the difficulty of finding its stable shape rapidly increases with an increase in the number of amino acids in the chain. A moderate protein has about 100 amino acids, and the number of combinations one needs to verify to find the stable structure is enormous. At some point, the number of these combinations will be so vast that classical computers cannot even attempt to solve them. In this paper, we examine how this problem can be solved with the help of quantum computing using two different algorithms, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate optimization Algorithm (QAOA), using Qiskit Nature.

In this research paper, a blockchain based methodology is proposed for analysis of social media forums for cryptocurrency phase shifts. Specifically, we use sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques to identify key themes and trends within cryptocurrency social media forums, and then use blockchain technology to verify and authenticate the data. Our results demonstrate that our approach is effective in identifying phase shifts in cryptocurrency markets. In recent years, social media forums have become a hub for discussions on cryptocurrency. The vast amount of data generated in these forums can be analyzed to predict the price shifts of different cryptocurrencies. However, traditional analysis methods may not be efficient enough to extract relevant information from this vast data. Therefore, this research study proposes a blockchain-based analysis approach to social media forums for cryptocurrency phase shifts.

Cryptocurrency price prediction is a challenging problem with non-stationary market price and volatility clustering. Cryp-tocurrency data tends to be non-stationary, which means that predictive information extracted using deep learning techniques on observed data can not be used with future data. Moreover, there is a very little signal in cryptocurrency data to indicate the future direction of the market. This paper proposes a sensible way to frame the prediction problem as a dynamic regression problem by defining the features in the feedforward neural networks and the target as an appropriate average of the historical data. The novelty of this paper is to use deep learning algorithms and statistical bootstrapping to obtain cryptocurrency price prediction and the corresponding prediction intervals.

CNN is extensively used in the area of image recognition and object detection for classification purposes. CNN is composed of several layers of filters to get feature maps of input data, yet foremost and crucial one is convolutional layer, hence the name Convolutional neural networks. However, the growth of quantum computing and quantum neural network in deep learning is limited. Three main obstacles that limit the growth of these are, first is due to the lack of real-time quantum computers to experiment with. Second is the improper training algorithms and at last, non-linearity nature of the neural networks. This paper introduces a novel approach to begin one's journey in quantum computing, along with solutions and developments. This work provides a detailed description of architectures, frameworks and algorithms used for implementing a QCNN model. The research was made regarding image recognition and object detection using QCNN and found that QCNN can increase the computational speeds with better performance metrics compared to classical computational methods. This paper also debates about applications of QCNN in computer vision, signal and image processing, Pharmaceuticals, Cryptography and various other fields.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol.

Specifically, we focus on the case when the observers perform a kind of a minimum-error type state discriminating measurement where the goal of the observers is to maximize their joint probability of successfully guessing the state that the qubit was initially prepared in. We call this the Joint Best Guess strategy. In this scheme, Alice prepares a qubit in one of two possible states. The qubit is first sent to Bob, who measures it, and then on to Charlie, and so on to altogether N consecutive receivers who all perform measurements on it. The goal for all observers is to determine which state Alice sent. In the Joint Best Guess strategy, every time a system is received the observer is required to make a guess, aided by the measurement, about its state. The price to pay for this requirement is that errors must be permitted, the guess can be correct or in error. There is a nonzero probability for all the receivers to successfully identify the initially prepared state, and we maximize this joint probability of success. This work is a step toward developing a theory of nondestructive sequential quantum measurements and could be useful in multiparty quantum communication schemes based on communicating with single qubits, particularly in schemes employing continuous variable states. It also represents a case where subsequent observers can probabilistically and optimally get around both the collapse postulate and the no-broadcasting theorem.","","978-1-7281-8969-7","10.1109/QCE49297.2020.00037","Army Research Laboratory(grant numbers:W911NF-20-2-0097); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259977","quantum information;quantum communication;sequential state discrimination","Receivers;Qubit;Observers;Extraterrestrial measurements;Protocols;Probabilistic logic;Optimization","probability;quantum computing;quantum cryptography;quantum entanglement","multiparty quantum communication schemes;N consecutive receivers;continuous variable states;single qubits;nondestructive sequential quantum measurements;initially prepared state;state Alice;joint probability;minimum-error type state discriminating measurement;sequential state discrimination measurements","","2","","18","IEEE","25 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There have been a number of research studies that have presented bitcoin price prediction models, but none of them have looked at the controlling variables linked with bitcoin transaction timestamps. It might be that price is not the only key criteria influencing bitcoin transactions, or the available model for bitcoin price prediction is yet to consider timestamp as a determining factor in its transaction. A better and more accurate model would be required to predict how the Timestamp influences changes of bitcoin transactions. That is why this current study utilized a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the prediction of timestamp influence on Bitcoin value. Bitcoin historical datasets which are converted to a nonlinear regression into a “well-formulated” statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression are used. Simulation analysis indicates that bitcoin digital currency’s performance variation is highly influenced by its transaction timestamp with the prediction accuracy of 96%. The contributions of this research lies with the fact that specific Bitcoin transaction events repeat themselves over and over again, meaning that the Open-Price, High-Price, Low-Price, and Close-Price of Bitcoin price over timestamp developed a pattern that was predicted by NARX with less That means those involved in the transaction of bitcoin at the wrong timestamp will certainly face the uncertainty negative effect of the bitcoin market.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124629","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), University of Jeddah, Jeddah(grant numbers:UJ-20-121-DR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597552","Bitcoin (digital currency);volume of BTC;bitcoin;timestamp","Bitcoin;Predictive models;Uncertainty;Bayes methods;Online banking;Computer science;Social networking (online)","autoregressive processes;computer simulation;cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;neural nets;pricing;regression analysis","bitcoin transaction timestamps;NARX;nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neural network model;bitcoin value;nonlinear regression;specific Bitcoin transaction events;high-price;low-price;bitcoin market;bitcoin price prediction models;timestamp influence prediction;bitcoin historical datasets;ridge regression;simulation analysis;bitcoin digital currency performance;open-price;close-price","","","","57","CCBY","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is known that these cryptographic schemes can be deciphered in a very short time by Shor’s algorithm when a quantum computer is put into practical use. Therefore, several methods have been proposed for quantum computer-resistant cryptosystems that cannot be cracked even by a quantum computer. A simple implementation of LWE-based lattice cryptography based on the LWE (Learning With Errors) problem requires a key length of O(n2) to ensure the same level of security as existing public-key cryptography schemes such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography. In this paper, we attacked the Ring-LWE (RLWE) scheme, which can be implemented with a short key length, with a modified LLL (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz) basis reduction algorithm and investigated the trend in the degree of field extension required to generate a secure and small key.

The Bitcoin network creates a complex system of economic incentives that governs its inner working, impacting the network's security guarantees and its evolution. Recent development of Bitcoin as a speculative asset and the herein skyrocketing Bitcoin price greatly incentivize participation in the network. We posit that the expansion in Bitcoin miner population and speculative transactions may not be socially desirable. The increased competition in Bitcoin mining not only exacerbates energy consumption and environmental cost, but also makes the risky mining business much riskier. In addition to the risk of unstable reward flows, the fluctuation in Bitcoin price makes the profitability of mining more uncertain. This research studies an alternative socially optimal model for the Bitcoin market (and other cryptocurrencies in general). Through equilibrium analysis, we emphasize the need to limit speculation in Bitcoin transactions, improve efficiency, diversify currency portfolio, and minimize negative externalities of the Bitcoin mining business.","","978-1-5386-5500-9","10.1109/ICISCE.2018.00126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8612624","Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, mining, competition, blockchain, economics, pricing, optimization, social optimum","Bitcoin;Sociology;Statistics;Protocols;Investment;Supply and demand","computer network security;cryptocurrencies;data mining;financial data processing;optimisation;pricing;transaction processing","Bitcoin transactions;Bitcoin mining business;cryptocurrency;distributed manner;complex system;economic incentives;Bitcoin miner population;speculative transactions;Bitcoin market;networks security guarantees;skyrocketing Bitcoin price;energy consumption;environmental cost;socially optimal Bitcoin mining;equilibrium analysis","","3","","14","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the rest of this paper we will use the terms “Bitcoin price” and “Bitcoin's exchange rate” interchangeably to represent the amount of fiat currency (USD) needed to buy one Bitcoin at a given time. We consider, besides classical properties, a novel notion of Trustful Transaction Graph introduced to describe partial Users Graphs derived by chains of 0-confirmation transactions. We present a temporal analysis of the evolution of a set of features with a single day granularity. Afterwards, we applied autoregressive distributed-lag linear regression to assess whether and with which strength and duration a change in the considered features is likely to influence the exchange rate up to a prespecified number of days (fifteen) in the future. The results show that some of the considered features significantly influence the exchange rate up to several days, and that such relationships are likely not to be spurious, since we found that those features contribute significantly to decrease the error in predicting the exchange rate.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2020.3008600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9138785","Bitcoin;price analysis;autoregressive distributed-lag linear regression;users graph.","Bitcoin;Exchange rates;Blockchain;Tools;Linear regression;Computer science","autoregressive processes;cryptocurrencies;data analysis;exchange rates;financial data processing;graph theory;regression analysis;transaction processing","popular cryptocurrency;Bitcoin Users Graph;Bitcoin exchange rate;Bitcoin price;0-confirmation transactions;trustful transaction graph;autoregressive distributed-lag linear regression;topological properties","","5","","33","IEEE","10 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The price of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile and is prone to rapid swings within short periods of time. This behaviour makes them a high-risk and high-return financial asset. The efficacy of neural networks in forecasting the high frequency financial time series has become widely accepted in the research community. This work explored the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a neural network based non-linear sequence model, to propose a novel algorithmic trading strategy for cryptocurrencies. The proposed novel high frequency algorithmic trading strategy built over an LSTM based short-term price forecasting is used for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This simple, yet effective trading algorithm uses the network's price forecasts to make buy and short selling decisions for cryptocurrency based on certain set criteria. The proposed trading strategy gives positive returns when backtested on Bitcoin hourly prices taken from yahoo! finance. We also verified the effectiveness of the trading strategy for Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, based on the positive backtesting returns. As an extension to the study, the proposed strategy is applied on an even higher frequency (minute by minute) Bitcoin price data, and the strategy gives positive backtesting returns in this extended study. We also provide fuzzy intervals for the algorithmic return of our strategy and compare those with corresponding intervals on a simple buy and hold strategy.","","978-1-6654-8768-9","10.1109/SSCI51031.2022.10022021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10022021","LSTM;Cryptocurrency;Fuzzy intervals;Mem-bership function;Financial time series;Algorithmic Trading;High Frequency Trading;Neural Networks;Time Series Fore-casting","Time-frequency analysis;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Time series analysis;Finance;Bitcoin;High frequency","cryptocurrencies;electronic trading;financial data processing;fuzzy set theory;pricing;recurrent neural nets;time series","algorithmic return;algorithmic trading model;alternative financial asset;Bitcoin hourly prices;buy;effective trading algorithm;Ethereum;high frequency financial time series;high-return financial asset;high-risk;higher frequency;largest cryptocurrency;Long Short Term Memory;LSTM;neural network;nonlinear sequence model;novel algorithmic trading strategy;novel high frequency algorithmic trading strategy;positive backtesting returns;positive returns;rapid swings;research community;short selling decisions;short-term price forecasting","","","","27","IEEE","30 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For alleviating such pitfalls, this study intends to forecast the Bitcoin price by comparing its deviations pre and post Covid using suitable ML algorithms. To achieve this, the study proposes Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with Optimized Genetic Algorithm (OGA). In this case, ARIMA model is considered as it possess the innate ability in capturing standard temporal reliances which is distinct to time-series data. Further, hyperparameters are selected by GA based on the fitness function. Based on this, hyperparameter tuning is performed which assist to improvise the model performance. For determining if there exists any deviations in Bitcoin price (pre and post Covid), Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test is considered.

However, the centralized computing topology of classical electric information system, where individual electricity consumption data are frequently transmitted to the cloud center for load forecasting, tends to violate electric consumers’ privacy as well as to increase the pressure on network bandwidth. To tackle the tricky issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework based on the edge-fog-cloud continuum for smart grid. Specifically, 1) we gravitate the training of load forecasting models and forecasting workloads to distributed smart meters so that consumers’ raw data are handled locally, and only the forecasting outputs that have been protected are reported to the cloud center via fog nodes; 2) we protect the local forecasting models that imply electricity features from model extraction attacks by model randomization; 3) we exploit a shuffle scheme among smart meters to protect the data ownership privacy, and utilize a re-encryption scheme to guarantee the forecasting data privacy. Finally, through comprehensive simulation and analysis, we validate our proposed privacy-preserving framework in terms of privacy protection, and computation and communication efficiency.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-3106-1","10.1109/WCNC45663.2020.9120680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9120680","","Data privacy;Cloud computing;Load forecasting;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Data models;Smart meters","Big Data;cryptography;data privacy;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;power consumption;power engineering computing;smart meters;smart power grids","planning;maintenance;smart grid;energy internet;short-term load forecasting;big data;machine learning technologies;centralized computing topology;classical electric information system;individual electricity consumption data;cloud center;electric consumers;edge-fog-cloud continuum;forecasting workloads;distributed smart meters;fog nodes;local forecasting models;electricity features;model extraction attacks;model randomization;data ownership privacy;forecasting data privacy;privacy protection;privacy-preserving framework","","2","","24","IEEE","19 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, Bitcoin’s erratic behavior has discouraged some potential investors. To get insights into its behavior and price fluctuation, past studies have discovered the correlation between Twitter sentiments and Bitcoin behavior. Most of them have exclusively focused on their relationships, instead of the Twitter sentiment analysis itself. Finding the most suitable classification algorithms for sentiment analysis for this kind of data is challenging. For the enormous data in Twitter, the supervised sentiment analysis approach of unlabeled data can be time-consuming and expensive, which has been studied to be superior to unsupervised ones. As such, we propose the HyVADRF (hybrid valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner (VADER)–random forest) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) model. A semantic and rule-based VADER was used to calculate polarity scores and classify sentiments, which overcame the weakness of manual labeling, while a random forest was utilized as its supervised classifier. Furthermore, considering Twitter’s massive size, we collected over 3.6 million tweets and analyzed various dataset sizes as these are related to the model’s learning process. Lastly, GWO parameter tuning was conducted to optimize the classifier’s performance. The results show that 1) the HyVADRF model had an accuracy of 75.29%, precision of 70.22%, recall of 87.70%, and F1-score of 78%. 2) The most ideal dataset size percentage is 90% of the total collected tweets ( $n =1$ ,249,060). 3) The standard deviations are 0.0008 for accuracy and F1-score and 0.0011 for precision and recall. Hence, the HyVADRF model consistently delivers stable results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3209662","Digital Science for Economy, Society, Human Resources Innovative Development and Environment Project through Reinventing Universities and Research Institutes(grant numbers:2046735); APNIC (Asia Pacific Network Information Centre) Foundation through SWITCH SEA (Supporting Women in Internet Research Leaders in Southeast Asia) Project-TH-03, for data science and applied AI professional knowledge, and research support; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9903427","Hyperparameter;random forest;bitcoin;gray wolf optimization;tweet sentiment analysis;VADER","Sentiment analysis;Blogs;Social networking (online);Bitcoin;Classification algorithms;Data models;Semantics","data mining;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","Twitter's massive size;3.6 million tweets;GWO parameter tuning;HyVADRF model;hybrid VADER-random forest;Bitcoin tweet sentiment;Bitcoin's erratic behavior;price fluctuation;Twitter sentiments;Bitcoin behavior;Twitter sentiment analysis;suitable classification algorithms;enormous data;supervised sentiment analysis approach;unlabeled data","","5","","54","CCBY","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work proposes the use of Mamdani interpretable fuzzy inference models for forecasting cryptocurrency price variation. For that, a genetic algorithm to optimize models accuracy is employed, limiting the quantity of rules and antecedents arbitrarily. A set of infeasible rules had to be discarded, in order to generate interesting models, that produce a relevant amount of trades.

However, some of the price changes have been due to organized manipulation. Traditionally known in the world of penny stocks and made illegal in most countries, pump and dump schemes are frequent in cryptocurrencies, and mostly unregulated. In this paper, we perform quantification and detection of pump and dump schemes that are coordinated through Telegram chats and executed on Binance - one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. We detail how pumps are organized on Telegram, and quantify the properties of 149 confirmed events with respect to market capitalization, trading volume, price impact and profitability. Based on this ground truth, and regular trading intervals obtained from twitter timestamps, we optimize a binary classifier in order to be able to detect additional suspicious trading activity.

Cryptocurrencies are volatile, which gives MIR4 players and traders a decision dilemma of when is the preferable time to buy, sell, or trade Draco Tokens. In this study we present deep learning models, specifically the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and Neural Prophet (NP) time series machine learning models to forecast future Draco-token exchange value. Historical data of Draco-token value from Yahoo Finance is utilized as a univariate parameter for the analysis, model development, and the forecasting of the future Draco-token exchange values. Performance of formulated models are assessed and compared based on the following regression metrics: RMSE, MSE, MAE and MAPE. Experimental results indicated that the LSTM Neural Network yielded better forecast estimates with lower error than the Neural Prophet. Findings of the study showed that LSTM can be utilized as a tool for forecasting future Draco token exchange values. future research direction suggests improving prediction accuracy by incorporating other parameters such as MIR-4 players sentiments, newly added players, and google search interest over time.","","979-8-3503-3936-9","10.1109/APSIT58554.2023.10201784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10201784","deep learning;Draco token;LSTM;Neural Prophet;forecasting;MIR-4","Deep learning;Measurement;Neural networks;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Internet;Nonfungible tokens","blockchains;cryptocurrencies;data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;neural nets;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;time series","cryptocurrency;deep learning models;Draco-token value;forecast future Draco-token exchange value;forecasting future Draco token exchange values;future Draco-token exchange values;Long-Short Term Memory neural network;MIR-4 Draco token exchange value forecasting;MIR-4 players;MIR4;Neural Prophet time series machine learning models;trade Draco Tokens;traders","","","","22","IEEE","9 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A lot of cryptocurrencies have been created since 2011 with Bitcoin dominating the cryptocurrencies' market. With plenty of cryptocurrencies being used as financial assets and with millions of trades being executed through different exchange services, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to trading problems and challenges similar to those traditionally encountered in the financial domain. Price and trend prediction, volatility prediction, portfolio construction and fraud detection are some examples related to trading. In addition, there are other challenges that are specific to the domain of cryptocurrencies such as mining, cybersecurity, anonymity and privacy. In this paper, we survey the application of artificial intelligence techniques to address these challenges for cryptocurrencies with their vast amount of daily transactions, trades and news that are beyond human capabilities to analyze and learn from.

This objective requires to specify whether investors can extend their exposure in certain asset classes and benefit their portfolios in a statistically significant way. In this paper, we address this issue of diversification in the context of cryptoasset portfolios and examine whether their risk-adjusted performance can be enhanced through seeking exposure into the commodities class. For an equally-weighted portfolio of five cryptoassets, we first consider the addition of physical gold, as conceptualised by the CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index, a diversified, monthly-rebalanced index that seeks exposure to both asset classes. We further consider modifying the index composition by replacing physical gold with a basket of five commodities. Mean-variance spanning tests reveal that the addition of physical gold in the original cryptoasset portfolio translates to a significant shift in the efficient frontier, both in terms of the global minimum variance and the tangency portfolios. Additionally, expanding the exposure in the commodity side confirms a statistically significant improvement, with the diversification benefit arising from a shift in the tangency portfolio. We further generate a number of price paths for the original index, the modified index and their components, according to a Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH specification, to assess the efficiency of the index weighted risk contribution scheme. Results demonstrate a superior performance of the two indices when compared against their constituents in terms of Omega ratio. The modified index appears more appropriate for investors that seek higher annual returns, while the original composition would be more appropriate for individuals with moderate annual return goals.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461107","Cryptoassets;Gold;Commodities;Index;Mean-Variance Spanning;Diversification","Gold;Correlation;Conferences;Computational modeling;Blockchain;Cryptocurrency;Indexes","asset management;autoregressive processes;cryptography;financial data processing;investment;risk management;share prices;stock markets","diversification benefits;cryptoasset portfolios;investment portfolios;asset classes;commodities class;equally-weighted portfolio;physical gold;CoinShares Gold;Cryptoassets Index;index composition;mean-variance spanning tests;tangency portfolio;index weighted risk contribution scheme;global minimum variance;dynamic conditional correlation GARCH specification;generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity","","","","25","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting from the relevant conceptual framework of Bitcoin, this paper divides the existing research models into three categories, heuristic algorithm identification of entities, transaction descriptive statistics and network analysis, and visual system analysis. By analyzing the transaction entity, Bitcoin transaction data can be processed in a manner which is similar to an account, such as a bank or credit card, thereby achieving the purpose of in-depth analysis of all transaction activities related to the account entity.

Given the high price and complexity, multi-tenancy has become a cost-effective pattern for QKD network operations. In this work, we concentrate on addressing the online multi-tenant provisioning (On-MTP) problem for QKD networks, where multiple tenant requests (TRs) arrive dynamically. On-MTP involves scheduling multiple TRs and assigning non-reusable secret keys derived from a QKD network to multiple TRs, where each TR can be regarded as a high-security-demand organization with the dedicated secret-key demand. The quantum key pools (QKPs) are constructed over QKD network infrastructure to improve management efficiency for secret keys. We model the secret-key resources for QKPs and the secret-key demands of TRs using distinct images. To realize efficient On-MTP, we perform a comparative study of heuristics and reinforcement learning (RL) based On-MTP solutions, where three heuristics (i.e., random, fit, and best-fit based On-MTP algorithms) are presented and a RL framework is introduced to realize automatic training of an On-MTP algorithm. The comparative results indicate that with sufficient training iterations the RL-based On-MTP algorithm significantly outperforms the presented heuristics in terms of tenant-request blocking probability and secret-key resource utilization.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.2964003","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601052,61822105); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019XD-A05); State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications of China(grant numbers:IPOC2019ZR01); China Association for Science and Technology, Swedish Research Council, Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, Swedish Foundation for International Collaboration in Research and Higher Education, and G??ran Gustafsson Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8950200","Quantum key distribution networks;online multi-tenant provisioning;heuristics;reinforcement learning","Security;Repeaters;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Optical fiber networks;Network architecture;Data communication","learning (artificial intelligence);private key cryptography;probability;quantum cryptography;scheduling","quantum key distribution networks;reinforcement learning;long-term security;QKD network operations;online multitenant provisioning;multiple tenant requests;high-security-demand organization;secret-key demand;quantum key pools;QKPs;QKD network infrastructure;secret-key resources;On-MTP algorithm;tenant-request blocking probability;secret-key resource utilization;data communications","","26","","67","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions.

As a result., there are concerns regarding its sustainability and carbon emission. If one wants to estimate these, they first should have an estimation of the network's energy consumption which is hard to calculate due to its decentralized nature. To do so., two methods are conceivable. First, considering electricity price and miner's revenue (electricity costs are considered as a part of total revenue., then divided by electricity price to obtain electricity consumption), second, using hash rate along with the efficiency of mining devices. The latter is utilized in this study for short- and long-term predictions. In the short-term, recurrent neural network (RNN) is used, whereas in the long-term logistic functions are applied. It has been concluded that the ultimate energy consumption of the Bitcoin network, which will happen around 2025, is in the range of 40.4 to 73.41 TWh annually and its estimated value is 58.56 TWh.","","978-1-6654-5285-4","10.1109/ICTEM56862.2023.10084150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10084150","Blockchain;Bitcoin energy consumption;Hash rate;Machine learning;Bitcoin energy consumption prediction","Energy consumption;Recurrent neural networks;Neurons;Estimation;Bitcoin;Proof of Work;Market research","blockchains;cryptocurrencies;data mining;energy consumption;power consumption;power generation economics;pricing;recurrent neural nets","Bitcoin energy consumption;Bitcoin network;carbon emission;consensus algorithm;long-term logistic functions;long-term predictions;mining devices;short-term prediction;sustainability;then divided by electricity price to obtain electricity consumption;ultimate energy consumption;work concept","","","","32","IEEE","4 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, the CPMA model is established to establish a risk assessment mechanism and make preconditions for the decision-making model. Finally, a reinforcement learning model is established based on artificial intelligence, and LSTM is used to extract data features and is combined with DQN algorithm to solve. Based on the CPMA model of problem one, we correlate this improved model with transaction costs. And conduct descriptive statistics on the relationship between yield rate and cost of revenue. It can be seen that the transaction cost adjustment has a large short-term impact on the market, and the long-term impact is relatively small.

Under these circumstances, in countries with cheap or subsidized electricity price, the introduction of profitable cryptocurrencies application is deeply penetrated. It has attracted many low-voltage customers to mine these digital currencies individually or in mining pools. The employed mining devices with their own unique constant load profile have escalated the coincident factor of the loads supplied by a transformer. This can highly overload the transformers engaged with loads of this type and, in the long term will cause destructive impacts not only on the transformer also on the distribution facilities. This paper studies the adverse effect of cryptocurrency mining loads on the distribution transformer aging. At first, the customer's profit analysis through mining operation has been introduced, realizing different electric energy pricing strategies. Finally, 105 real-world distribution substations have been monitored over one year, and their actual load profiles data are recorded for analysis. A relation between the penetration rate of the mining devices and the transformer's expected lifetime is determined in this work. It is shown that the distribution transformers' expected lifetime will decrease by 25% in the presence of only a 5% penetration rate of cryptocurrency miners. This is an alarming statistic for distribution networks operating under the presence of cryptocurrency mining loads. This should be strictly addressed in the future planning of these distribution networks.","","978-1-6654-5183-3","10.1109/EPDC56235.2022.9817210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817210","aging;b itco in;blockchain;cryptocurrency;distribution transformer","Substations;Online banking;Privatization;Power distribution;Distribution networks;Pricing;Transformers","cryptocurrencies;data mining;power distribution economics;power distribution planning;power engineering computing;power markets;power transformers;pricing;substations","cryptocurrency mining loads;cheap electricity price;subsidized electricity price;profitable cryptocurrencies application;digital currencies;mining pools;mining devices;constant load profile;distribution facilities;mining operation;real-world distribution substations;actual load profiles data;distribution networks;distribution transformer loss-of- life assessment;electric energy pricing strategies","","1","","29","IEEE","14 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An NFT is a special kind of cryptographic token that represents the ownership of a unique piece of digital property. They are tamper-proof due to the use of distributed public ledger that records verified information across a network of computers. With the rise of crypto-trading, the NFT market segment has seen an accumulation in its trading volume in the capital market. There are various factors determining the price and sales of the NFTs and there is a need for meaningful insights from the data generated intermittently over time. With this as motivation, this proposed research work explores the factors that create an impact on the NFT market and in-depth data analysis with the help of brokerage firm data. This proposed work helps NFT enthusiasts would be able to derive the correlation between cryptocurrency market and NFT market.","","978-1-6654-9365-9","10.1109/GlobConPT57482.2022.9938298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9938298","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Non Fungible Tokens;Data Analysis;Brokerage Firms;Sentiment Analysis","Computers;Data analysis;Correlation;Social networking (online);Neural networks;Pricing;Machine learning","cryptography;data analysis;financial data processing;pricing","brokerage firm data;capital market;crypto-trading;cryptocurrency market;cryptographic token;digital property;distributed public ledger;in-depth data analysis;NFT enthusiasts;NFT market segment;NonFungible Tokens pricing;trading volume","","1","","10","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel machine-learning model, solving a binary classification problem, that can predict transaction fee volatility in the Bitcoin network so that users can optimize their fees expenses and the approval time for their transactions. The model's output will give a confidence score whether a new incoming transaction will be included in the next mined block. The model is trained on data from a longitudinal study of the Bitcoin blockchain, containing more than 10 million transactions. New features that we generate include information on how many bytes were already occupied by other transactions in the mempool, assuming they are ordered by fee density in each mining pool. The collected dataset allows to generate a model for transaction inclusion pattern prediction in the Bitcoin network, hence telling whether a transaction is well formed or not, according to the previous transactions analyzed.

But a huge amount of data is required for training the Machine learning model. When an organization wants to analyze their profit rate it has to send its data to third party which may reveal organization's business tactics or sensitive data. Hence, there is always a risk of data privacy. So, privacy preserving is used. Privacy preserving prevents data leakage from machine learning algorithms. There are many privacy preserving machine learning strategies which are used for data privacy. Homomorphic Encryption is one such technique. In homomorphic encryption, the data to be fed to train the machine learning model is encrypted. The encrypted data is then fed to the machine learning model.

A lot of algorithms are being expounded for providing data security and most of these algorithms use random key generations, and perform arithmetic operations with the key. This paper puts forward a new encryption/decryption algorithm that is based on the ASCII, Binary-Bit sequence and further uses the XOR operation. It insinuates encryption at compound stages and the key is imparted by the user. In the proposed algorithm, the original data will be encrypted at multiple stages and a key will be made use for encryption of plaintext to cipher text; next same key will be put to use for decryption of cipher to plain text.

The microgrids generate electricity for self-use and sell surplus energy locally in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) manner, where seller and buyer meet to trade electricity directly on agreed terms without any intermediary. The energy trading decision for the microgrid is a challenging issue due to uncertainty of renewable energy yield, the electric demands of EVs and without knowing the offers of other competitive microgrids together makes it hard to decide the selling price of energy per unit. Further, there is a need to audit and verify the energy trading and store energy transactions securely in distributed manner to avoid collapse of the system in case of single point of failure. In this context, this paper presents a Blockchain and Quantum Reinforcement Learning based optimized Energy Trading (BQL-ET) model for E-mobility. Firstly, a double-auction mechanism is proposed to set optimal market-trading price by observing the selling price of each microgrid and the demand of EV's. Secondly, using smart contracts, consortium blockchain is deployed for the evaluation of overall utility, which includes energy supply, demand, and cost for both microgrids and EVs. Finally, Utility maximization problem is transformed into a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and in order to develop the learning policy and maximize overall utility, a QRL optimization for solving the MDP problem is proposed. Convergence analysis and performance results attest that BQL-ET convergences faster, maximizes the utility of both microgrids an EVs with lower transaction confirmation time and setting of the optimal market-trading price compared to state-of-the art models.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3225524","Galgotias University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039707","Blockchain;electric vehicles;energy trading;microgrids;quantum reinforcement learning","Microgrids;Blockchains;Security;Convergence;Privacy;Costs;Uncertainty","blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;decision making;distributed power generation;electric vehicle charging;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;optimisation;peer-to-peer computing;power engineering computing;power markets;pricing;reinforcement learning","Blockchain;competitive microgrids;E-mobility;electric demands;Electric mobility;Electric Vehicles;electricity;energy supply;energy trading decision;microgrid;optimal market-trading price;optimized Energy Trading model;Peer-to-Peer manner;Quantum Reinforcement Learning;renewable energy yield;selling price;store energy transactions;surplus energy","","","","39","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the advent of Smart Grids being developed world wide, the most widely accepted strategy is Demand-Response management. In this strategy, the customers or end-users are incentivized to change their energy-utility behavior with time in response to fluid price changes or to induce lower energy consumption during peak demand time. The system is controlled by a cloud of servers that monitor the demand- supply chain over a network all the time. This brings up the issue of security within the operations of the system.

In order to solve the problem that data sharing and privacy protection can not be balanced, a PV power prediction model based on federated learning is proposed in this paper. On the premise of ensuring the information security of each local power data, the collection of decentralized data and joint multi-party data are constructed. At the same time, under the condition that the data of each power station are confidential to each other, the federated server collects the encrypted training parameters of each power station after local training for integration training, and makes PV power generation prediction without sacrificing security and privacy of the power station. The result shows the prospect of federated learning for forecasting the power of photovoltaic power stations without compromising privacy.","","978-1-83953-606-9","10.1049/icp.2021.2326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9654016","","","Big Data;cryptography;data integration;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;power generation planning","federated learning-based forecasting model;privacy protection;data sharing;photovoltaic power stations;big data;machine learning;multiple PV power stations;data integration;information security;data privacy;PV power prediction model;local power data;decentralized data;joint multiparty data;PV power generation prediction","","","","","","17 Dec 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In this scenario the DSO is interested in exploiting EV charges in terms of flexibility that can be planned in optimized way, especially when it is combined with high penetration of RES. This paper provides evidence that EVs charging sessions, planned using a dedicated forecasting module, can contribute to balance the distribution power network; for this purpose suitable flexibility-enabling technologies developed under the H2020 project SOFIE have been used. Data analysis has pointed out that a proper program of charging sessions could significantly increase self-consumption index; moreover, an optimal scheduling has been validated taking into account realistic constraints for its actual implementation. Finally, the paper shows how the enabling technologies for flexibility exploitation have been implemented and validated; notably, a rescheduling of the charging sessions is allowed through the usage of forecasting techniques as well as the implementation of blockchain technologies for enabling a flexibility marketplace.","","978-1-7281-7455-6","10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope49358.2020.9160781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9160781","Electric Vehicles;flexibility;self-consumption;reverse power flow;Distributed Ledger Technology;forecasting algorithm","Forecasting;Production;Load flow;Electric vehicle charging;Machine learning;Research and development;Europe","automobiles;cryptocurrencies;data analysis;distributed databases;distribution networks;power engineering computing;power generation planning;power generation scheduling;power grids","electric car usage;electric power network challenges;EV charges;forecasting module;distribution power network;optimal scheduling;blockchain technologies;electric vehicles;Europe","","6","","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it has been widely reported that it can be used for investment scams, which are referred to as high yield investment programs (HYIP). Although from the security forensic point of view it is very important to identify the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, so far in the open technical literature no systematic method which reliably collects and identifies such Bitcoin addresses has been proposed. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced, which efficiently collects a large number of the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses and identifies them based upon a novel analysis of their transactions history. In particular, a scraping-based method is first proposed which is able to collect more than 2,000 HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses from the Internet thus providing a large number of the HYIPs' samples. Second, a supervised machine learning technique, which classifies, whether or not, specific Bitcoin addresses belong to the HYIP operators, is introduced and its performance is evaluated. The proposed classification method is based upon two novel approaches, namely the rate conversion technique that mitigates the effect of Bitcoin price volatility and the sampling technique that reduces the computational amount without sacrificing the classification performance. By employing close to 30,000 real Bitcoin addresses, extensive performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulation experiments have shown that the proposed methodology achieves excellent performance, i.e., 95% of the HYIP addresses can be correctly classified, while maintaining a false positive rate less than 4.9%. In order to further validate the proposed classifier's ability to detect the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, our designed classifier has been tested against a recently published list of the HYIP addresses maintaining its excellent detection accuracy by achieving a 93.75% success rate.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2921087","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(grant numbers:JP18K18162); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731919","Bitcoin;blockchain analysis;forensics;data mining;HYIP (high yield investment programs)","Bitcoin;Blockchain;Investment;Forensics;History","cryptocurrencies;digital forensics;supervised learning","HYIP addresses;Bitcoin price volatility;supervised machine learning technique;scraping-based method;security forensic;high yield investment programs;investment scams;bitcoin addresses identification;HYIP operators","","41","","29","OAPA","5 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among this direction of efforts, Ring-Binary-Learning-with-Errors (RBLWE)-based encryption scheme (RBLWE-ENC) is regarded as a promising lightweight PQC fitting Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge computing applications. As hardware implementation for PQC algorithms has become one of the major advances in the field, in this paper, we follow this trend to present an efficient implementation of RBLWE-ENC lightweight accelerator on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. Overall, we have demonstrated three coherent interdependent stages of efforts: (i) we have presented detailed derivation processes to formulate the proposed algorithmic operation; (ii) we have then implemented the proposed algorithm into a desired hardware accelerator; and (iii) we provided thorough complexity analysis and comparison to showcase the superior performance of the proposed accelerator over the state-of-the-art designs, e.g., the proposed accelerator with $v=8$ has at least 66.67% less area-time complexities than the existing ones (Virtex-7 FPGA).

TESAT's LCTs have successfully accomplished more than 25.000 links in the past six years. In this paper, an overview of the results generated during this time is presented. Eight LCTs 135, 1064 nm wavelength are/have been in operation in the past six years. Two LCTs are on board of geostationary satellites (GEOs) and six are/were on board of low-orbit satellites (LEOs) covering wide range of missions from earth observation (e.g. Copernicus program) and surveillance to technology demonstrator payloads (e.g. TDP1 Experimentation Program) [1] [2]. Space to ground links (SGLs) have been demonstrated using different art of optical ground stations (OGS). Upand down-optical links with and without communication between the Technology Demonstrator Payload 1 (TDP1) and the DLR Transportable Adaptive Optics Ground Station (T-AOGS) [12] have been used for experimental purpose, contributing to the data generation for atmospheric modelling and supporting the experts in building a better understanding of atmospheric impact onto the optical channel [3]. In order to implement and operate the LCTs, new operational concepts have been developed. Generation of operational products like link requests or commanding files has been supported and tuned [5] [2]. Further technology applications like airborne terminals are currently under validation. In 2019, several companies have started the verification of their terminals using the E2E test bed TDP1 and the T-AOGS described in [4]. Testing campaigns are ongoing in 2019. The TDP1 test bed has also supported quantum key distribution (QKD) verifications [7] [13] and optical channel characterization [9]. Methods for analysis, characterization and assessment of trends and performances of the LCTs in space and OGS have been developed and implemented. The Long Term Performance Analysis (LTPA) enables the assessment of potential degradations and allows for an introduction of corresponding counter measures (i.e. parameter settings modifications) preventing from negative impact on operations and services [6] [10]. The knowledge gained from the TDP1 Program has been an important contribution to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS).

Sliding window is used to obtain point cloud datasets from a multidimensional time series (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple). We apply persistent homology to quantify transient loops that appear in multiscale topological spaces, which associated on each point cloud dataset and encode the quantified information in a persistence landscape. Temporal changes in persistence landscapes are measured via their L1-norms. Consequently, a new representative is attained, called L1-norms time series. The L1-norms is associated with indicators: autocorrelation function at lag 1, variance and mean power spectrum at low frequencies to detect the signals. By using Kendall's tau correlation and significance test, significant rising trend events that occur before major financial crashes in Bitcoin are defined as the signals. A threshold is determined to scan entire data and record all the significant rising trend events. Lastly, we compare L1-norms with residuals time series, which is another representative obtained from de-trending approach. Our result portrays that autocorrelation function at lag 1 and variance of the L1-norms successfully detect early warning signals before the 2017 and 2019 major financial crashes. However, variance of the L1-norms is better since it able to signal another 2018 major financial crash. For the residuals, no early warning signals are detected. Hence, persistent homology provides a better representative than de-trending approach.

The concept behind a pairs trading of stocks is similar to the statistical idea of cointegration. The goal of pairs trading is to profit from the relative price movements of the two assets, rather than from the absolute price movements of either asset. This strategy is generally implemented using algorithmic trading techniques, and it is often used by traders and investors to take advantage of mispricing in the market.

However, KFs are sensitive to model errors. Misspecified modelling produces unstable solutions for dynamic systems. Fading-Memory Filter (FMF) uses a discounting weight to past observations. Compared to a standard KF, FMF addresses more recent observations and is more resilient (less sensitive) to modelling errors. However, the FMF algorithm does not provide slope parameter covariance matrix updates and innovation volatility forecasts. This paper proposes a novel resilient FMF algorithm for pairs trading and multiple trading by defining an appropriate data-driven innovation volatility forecasting model. The FMF-based strategies are implemented through some experiments on the hourly prices (high-frequency data) of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. It is shown that the proposed FMF trading strategies outperform the existing KF trading strategies and they are more profitable in the bear market over time, especially for continuous falling of prices and the short-lived and sharp rally recovery where prices are not stationary.","0730-3157","979-8-3503-2697-0","10.1109/COMPSAC57700.2023.00206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196984","Pairs Trading;Multiple Trading;Fading-Memory Filter;Kalman Filter;Resilient Filter;Data-Driven Volatility;High Frequency;Cryptocurrency","Technological innovation;Heuristic algorithms;Predictive models;Filtering algorithms;Software;Kalman filters;Dynamical systems","covariance matrices;cryptocurrencies;Kalman filters;pricing;profitability;stock markets","accurate hedge ratio estimates;appropriate data-driven innovation volatility forecasting model;co-integrated nonstationary stock prices;commonly used pairs;dynamic system;existing KF trading strategies;FMF trading strategies;FMF-based strategies;high-frequency data;Kalman Filter;mean reversion;misspecified modelling;modelling errors;multiple trading strategies;novel fading-Memory Filter multiple trading strategy;novel resilient FMF algorithm;pairs trading;profitable data-driven algorithmic trading algorithm;short-term innovation volatility;slope parameter covariance matrix updates;standard KF","","","","13","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As supporting homomorphic operations over encrypted data without decryption, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) contributes to machine learning classification without leaking user privacy, especially in the outsouring scenario. In this paper, we propose an improved FHE scheme based on HElib, which is a FHE library implemented based on Brakerski's FHE scheme. Our improvement focuses on two aspects. On the one hand, we first use the relinearization technique to reduce the ciphertext size, and then the modulus switching technique is used to reduce the modulus and decryption noise. On the other hand, we need no relinearization and modulus switching if there is additive homomorphic or no homomorphic operation in the multiplicative ciphertext's next homomorphic operation. Homomorphic comparison protocol, private hyperplane decision-based classification and private Naïve Bayes classification are implemented by additive homomorphic and multiplicative homomorphic first. In our homomorphic comparison protocol, the number of interactions is reduced from 3 to 1. We choose the proposed FHE scheme to implement private decision tree classification. Simulation results show that the efficiency of our FHE scheme and implementation of private decision tree classification are more efficient than other two schemes.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2018.2794611","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702342,61702341,61602316); Science and Technology Innovation(grant numbers:JCYJ20160307150216309,JCYJ20170302151321095); Young Teachers of Shenzhen University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8260844","Machine learning classification;privacy preserving;fully homomorphic encryption;hyperplane decision-based;Naïve Bayes;decision tree","Decision trees;Encryption;Additives;Switches;Protocols;Privacy","Bayes methods;Big Data;cryptography;data analysis;data privacy;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","decryption;fully homomorphic encryption;machine learning classification;relinearization technique;modulus switching technique;homomorphic comparison protocol;private hyperplane decision-based classification;private Naïve Bayes classification;private decision tree classification;big data analysis;encrypted data;Brakerski FHE scheme;private machine learning classification;trend prediction;multiplicative ciphertext","","53","","40","IEEE","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Transactions in the Ethereum network, such as invokations of smart contracts used to control an IoT device, have no fairness or eventuality guarantees.

To restore the computer's functionality and user files, the malware demands a ransom, which must be paid in the form of cryptocurrency within a stipulated period. The deleterious effects caused by ransomware must be detected and addressed promptly. It is often difficult to perceive the metrics and parameters to look for, particularly when conducting experiments with unfamiliar ransomware variants. Traditionally, analysis carried out on these suspicious files can be categorized as static or dynamic based analysis. Static-based signature analysis is tremendously affected because of its nature of generating hard-coded policies or rules. Attackers often attempt to breach them by employing various techniques like code obfuscation, encryption, packaging, etc. While the dynamic analysis provides more insights into the analyzed files. The proposed work observes the behavioral aspects of ransomware and builds a generic model using machine learning techniques to detect the variants of ransomware families. Such threats must be detected early, i.e., before encryption takes place. Early detection, however, is hampered by a lack of sufficient information in the early stages of an attack, which leads to low detection accuracy and a high rate of false alarms. Currently, available solutions assume that there is complete knowledge of the behavior of such attacks at the time of detection, but that is not the case. The same is not true for early detection which takes place during an attack when the data are not fully accessible. Our paper proposes a novel technique to address these limitations called Augmented Bootstrapping and this method analyses the API calls made by the ransomware along with their timestamps. These timestamps indicate the API call sequences, which in turn help in constructing the N-gram model. The names of API calls are concatenated together to generate the bigram, trigram, 4-gram, and 5-gram models. Further, TF-IDF scores will be calculated for each of these N-grams sequences, and a machine learning model will be trained based on these values. The method analyses API call sequences of each of the active applications in the system and confirms the ransomware attack when it matches a malicious call sequence pattern. Our empirical results confirm that the proposed work could detect ransomware attacks with high accuracy and fewer false predictions.","","978-1-6654-8328-5","10.1109/ICOEI53556.2022.9777099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9777099","Ransomware;Mitigation method;API Calls;N-Grams;Behavior model;Decision making","Training;Measurement;Machine learning;Packaging;Market research;Encryption;Behavioral sciences","application program interfaces;computer bootstrapping;cryptocurrencies;file organisation;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","malicious call sequence pattern;API call sequences;machine learning techniques;cryptocurrency;computer functionality;static based signature analysis;API calls;low detection accuracy;ransomware families;file analysis;dynamic analysis;encryption;dynamic based analysis;suspicious files;unfamiliar ransomware variants;computer;user files;infected computers;malware;augmented bootstrapping;automated dynamic detection;ransomware attack","","1","","23","IEEE","24 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The appalling nature of Ethereum transactions to have both, security and threat at a comparable level, demands analytics for inferring traits for better perspectives and insights. This research work focuses on characteristic analysis of Ethereum transaction space for inferring behavioural traits in supervised and unsupervised context. In an unsupervised environment, raw transaction data is extradited to a tabular transaction structure by selecting appropriate features. The data is further clustered and validated to form coherent groupings of similar patterns. The clusters are characteristically analyzed based on the features through Radar plots for inferring behavioural traits. In supervised context, labelled transactions are represented using histograms and feature-based characteristic analysis is performed to infer traits. Such analytics lay foundations for future deeper analysis that can be used to discover trends and patterns to understand the transaction network, enhancement of trading strategies, identification of bot activities, anomaly detection and several others.","","978-1-7281-9080-8","10.1109/ICCP51029.2020.9266176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9266176","Ethereum;Blockchain;Analytics;Clustering;Behaviour","Radar;Blockchain;Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Market research;Smart contracts;Machine learning algorithms","behavioural sciences computing;contracts;cryptocurrencies;data analysis;financial data processing;financial management;pattern clustering;supervised learning;transaction processing;unsupervised learning","decentralized applications;Ethereum cryptocurrency;public ledger recording;Ethereum transactions;behavioural traits;histograms;feature-based characteristic analysis;transaction network;transactional data analytics;Ethereum blockchain network;smart contracts;supervised context;unsupervised context;anomaly detection","","4","","24","IEEE","26 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We pose FDIAs as sparse optimization problems to achieve initial attack objectives and remain stealthy during attacks. We propose a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the problems and explore additional sparse-state attacks. The experimental results show that for IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems, the success rate of two-state sparse attacks with small-scale targets is as high as 80%. In addition, the attack success rate can continue to increase as the number of attack states increases.

Among all security threats, the hardware trojan (HT) inserted into the integrated circuit is one of the most concerns. As a flexible and nondestructive approach, the side-channel analysis techniques are widely used for HT detection. However, noise sensitivity and golden chip dependence make side-channel based approaches face greatly challenge in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel HT detection approach based on Isolation Forest, which provides high precision detection capability, while reducing the dependence of the golden chip. First, we perform special preprocessing, named Main Difference Accumulation (MDA), on the side-channel information to magnify the impacts of HT. Then, we train the isolation forest model using the processed information. During the test phase, the obtained model can score the test data. Finally, we complete the detection of HT based on the score and threshold. Moreover, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to achieve the automatic selection of the threshold in the isolation forest. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, we select the power signal as the side-channel information and insert four different kinds of HTs into the AES-128 crypto core. Results obtained using a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA board show that the accuracy of HT detection can reach 100%, with a 1.13% relative area ratio of the original circuit.","","978-1-6654-0396-2","10.1109/BigDataSE50710.2020.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9343363","hardware trojan detection;side-channel analysis (SCA);Isolation Forest (iForest)","Training;Sensitivity;Power demand;Clustering algorithms;Forestry;Hardware;Trojan horses","cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA board;AES-128 crypto core;automatic threshold selection;K-means clustering algorithm;noise sensitivity;golden chip dependence;HT detection approach;main difference accumulation;hardware security;isolation forest-based detection method;machine learning;hardware trojan detection;isolation forest model;side-channel information;high precision detection capability;side-channel based approaches;side-channel analysis techniques;nondestructive approach;flexible approach;security threats;global industry chain;integrated circuit design","","2","","18","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this goal, we utilise a Systematic Mapping Study approach. The paper presents an in-depth assessment of statistical and thematic analysis of research maturity and the types of researchers, with specific emphasis on types of central bank use-cases considered for blockchain adaptation. Our work contributes to an understanding of where the most or least attention is directed, allowing for identification of gaps and opportunities for both academics, practitioners and combinations of each. Results show that the research topic is a comparatively new domain. It confirms the gap between depth and volume of the research provision from industry and academia, with industry leading the trend. Our study also found that the most research-intensive use-cases are those for: 1) Central Bank issued Digital Currency (CBDC), 2) Regulatory Compliance and 3) Payment Clearing and Settlement Systems (PCS) operated by central banks; a comparatively low engagement was found in the areas of 4) Assets Transfer/Ownership and 5) Audit Trail.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012295","Ph.D. Studentship from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K.(grant numbers:EP/R512497/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149861","Assets transfer;assets ownership;audit trail;blockchain;CBDC;challenges;central bank;central bank digital currency;distributed ledger technology;DLT;financial regulation;literature review;mapping study;opportunities;payment clearing and settlement;PCS;regulatory compliance;research maturity;research trend;use-case","Law;Systematics","bank data processing;cryptography;data privacy;distributed databases","Audit Trail;Assets Ownership;Assets Transfer;PCS;Payment Clearing and Settlement Systems;Regulatory Compliance;CBDC;Central Bank issued Digital Currency;thematic analysis;statistical analysis;systematic mapping study;DLT use-cases;blockchain application;blockchain adaptation;Distributed Ledger Technology use-cases;Central Banks","","25","","108","CCBY","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is because of the massive usage of end-to-end security protocols over Internet such as HTTPS and QUIC. The encryption trend will continue to rapidly increase in the future, and this trend concerns video streaming applications as well. Network providers face a serious challenge in managing their networks due to such widespread deployment of end-to-end security protocols. These operators need to have a clear visibility into traffic on their networks to monitor and manage both quality of experience (QoE)-and-service (QoS) impairments in popular video streaming services, in the most effective and efficient manner. Moreover, so many factors that influence QoE need to be taken care of to get an acceptable user experience. Most of the existing solutions use the deep packet inspection to infer these factors from the encrypted traffic. However, these solutions are inefficient, most of the time, leading to low QoE inference accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine-learning based solution that leverages a random forest classifier for a better QoE inference accuracy. The proposed solution uses network-and-transport layer information to infer QoE factors such as startup delay and stall events. It helps the network providers to react quickly and in real time for any impairments in the QoE of the encrypted video traffic. We evaluate our solution using an HTTP adaptive streaming service (YouTube) that uses HTTPS and QUIC protocols. Our experimental results show that our solution achieves up to 91.1% classification accuracy for HTTPS and up to 87.3% for QUIC.","2376-6506","978-1-7281-3129-0","10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148208","QoE;HTTP adaptive streaming;Encrypted video traffic;Classification accuracy;inferring QoE;Machine learning;Random Forest","Quality of experience;Streaming media;Bit rate;Monitoring;Encryption;Delays","computer network security;cryptography;hypermedia;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;quality of service;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming","inferring quality;adaptive video streaming;HTTPS;Internet traffic encryption;privacy;security concerns;end-to-end security protocols;encryption trend;video streaming applications;network providers;popular video streaming services;influence QoE;acceptable user experience;encrypted traffic;low QoE inference accuracy;machine-learning based solution;QUIC protocols;HTTP adaptive streaming service;encrypted video traffic;QoE factors;-transport layer information","","3","","25","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The video streaming session is subdivided into a stream of short time slots of 1s length, while considering two additional macro windows each for the current streaming trend and the whole ongoing streaming session. Constant memory features are extracted from the encrypted network traffic in these three windows in a stream-based fashion, and fed into a random forest model, which predicts whether the current time slot contains stalling or not. The presented system can predict stalling with a very high accuracy and the finest granularity to date (1s), and thus, can be used in networks for real-time QoE analysis from encrypted YouTube video streaming traffic. The independent predictions for each consecutive slot of a streaming session can further be aggregated to obtain stalling estimations for the whole session. Thereby, the proposed method allows to quantify the initial delay, as well as the overall number of stalling events and the stalling ratio, i.e., the ratio of total stalling time and total playback time.","2472-8144","978-1-5386-8336-1","10.1109/ICIN.2019.8685901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8685901","","","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;social networking (online);telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming","stalling estimations;stalling events;stalling ratio;total stalling time;total playback time;stream-based machine;real-time QoE analysis;encrypted video streaming traffic;HTTP adaptive video;encrypted network traffic;video streaming session;short time slots;current streaming trend;current time slot;encrypted YouTube video streaming traffic;random forest model;Quality of Experience degradation;macro windows","","36","","27","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, how to improve the efficiency of GWAS while protecting the privacy of genomic data becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient GWAS scheme. By using secure three-party computation, we present a series of protocols, i.e., Secure Quality Control, Secure Principle Component Analysis, Secure Cochran-Armitage trend test, and Secure Logistic Regression, to cover the most significant procedures of secure GWAS. In these protocols, a new comparison protocol is designed to reduce communication and improve efficiency. Furthermore, by extending the above comparison protocol to be maliciously secure and utilizing other technologies, e.g., consistency check, we extend the whole GWAS scheme to malicious security with rationally additional overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our protocols achieve about 33% performance improvement than the state-of-art secure GWAS scheme using two-party computation in terms of runtime and communication in the semi-honest setting. The cost of our scheme in the malicious setting is around 1.5X than that in the semi-honest setting.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3152498","National Key R&D Plan of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61825203,U1736203); Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research(grant numbers:2019B030302008); Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology(grant numbers:2019B010137002,2017B010111005); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102166,61902067); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0112802); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B0101360001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072215); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716830","Genome-wide association study;statistics;secure three-party computation;malicious security","Protocols;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Security;Logistics;Diseases;Computational modeling","bioinformatics;biology computing;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;diseases;genetics;genomics;logistic regression;medical computing;polymorphism;quality control;regression analysis","33% performance improvement;comparison protocol;disease diagnosis;diseases;efficient GWAS scheme;high-quality results;individuals;large-scale genome-Wide Association Study;large-scale genomic data;malicious security;malicious setting;multiparty computation;privacy;Secure Cochran-Armitage trend test;Secure Logistic Regression;Secure Principle Component Analysis;Secure Quality Control;Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms;state-of-art secure GWAS scheme;statistical techniques;three-party computation;two-party computation","","2","","43","IEEE","18 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accordingly, we developed a comprehensive model to help some traders with optimal transaction decisions. Given that the portfolio of cash, bitcoin and gold is gradually becoming a new choice for high returns, we chose these assets as examples to build a model to forecast the closing prices of bitcoin and gold for the next trading day based on their past stream up to today with LSTM (LongShort Term Memory) Neural Network Model. To achieve the maximum return, we used the Mean-variance Model to set the investment ratio of bitcoin and gold as variables for mathematical programming and solved the multivariate equations to find the optimal portfolio. The investment weights for each trade were obtained by comparing the lowest risk portfolio and the optimal return portfolio, i.e., the minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio scenarios.

End-to-end deep learning models are becoming increasingly ubiq-uitous given their ease of use, i.e., developers do not need to engineer features, and their apparent versatility. However, deep learning entails black-box models that hinder the capability to debug and explain classifications. Moreover, the computational complexity of deep learning can incur unnecessary latency, which is problematic for real-time classification needs. In this paper, we propose a methodology to interpret black-box, deep learning-based encrypted network traffic classification models, with an attempt to understand the dominant features a classifier is focusing on for a given task. We evaluate our approach on state-of-the-art deep learning classification techniques for encrypted per-packet classification and demonstrate how interpretability can be used to debug and improve the training pipeline while significantly reducing the size of the deep learning model.

Hence, it is essential to implement security schemes and to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of electronic circuits. Toward this end, the concept of physically unclonable functions (PUFs) has been established at the beginning of the 21st century. However, most PUFs have eventually, at least partially, fallen short of their promises, which are unpredictability, unclonability, uniqueness, reproducibility, and tamper resilience. That is because most PUFs directly utilize the underlying microelectronics, but that intrinsic randomness can be limited and may thus be predicted, especially by machine learning. Optical PUFs, in contrast, are still considered as promising-they can derive strong, hard-to-predict randomness independently from microelectronics, by using some kind of “optical token.” Here, we propose a novel concept for plasmonics-enhanced optical PUFs, or peo-PUFs in short. For the first time, we leverage two highly nonlinear phenomena in conjunction by construction: first, light propagation in a silicon disk resonator, and second, surface plasmons arising from nanoparticles arranged randomly on top of the resonator. We elaborate on the physical phenomena, provide simulation results, and conduct a security analysis of peo-PUFs for secure key generation and authentication. This study highlights the good potential of peo-PUFs, and our future work is to focus on fabrication and characterization of such PUFs.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2019.2920949","Center for Cyber Security at NYUAD/NYU; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731637","Hardware security;optical waveguide;physically unclonable function;plasmonics;silicon disc resonator","Optical sensors;Nonlinear optics;Optical resonators;Resonators;Optical device fabrication;Optical scattering;Silicon","cryptography;fraud;integrated optics;light propagation;nanoparticles;nanophotonics;nonlinear optics;optical resonators;plasmonics;silicon;surface plasmons","nanoparticles;light propagation;highly nonlinear phenomena;hard-to-predict randomness;optical token;plasmonics-enhanced optical PUF;machine learning;tamper resilience;microelectronics;physically unclonable functions;intrinsic randomness;unclonability;electronic circuits;trustworthiness;reliability;security schemes;identity fraud;data theft;omnipresent digitalization trend;plasmonics-enhanced silicon disc resonators;authentication;secure key generation;physical phenomena;surface plasmons;silicon disk resonator","","11","","41","IEEE","5 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we analyze the privacy protection issues in the blockchain and conclude that secure multi-party computing can make up for the security flaws in the blockchain. Secondly, we summarize the developing secure multi-party computing technology based on blockchain, which are the Zero-knowledge proof scheme, the secret sharing scheme, and the homomorphic encryption scheme. At the same time, we have conducted a security analysis of the multi-party computing technology in the blockchain, and believe that these three technologies can well solve the privacy protection problem in the blockchain. Finally, we look forward to the development trend of the secure multi-party computing in the blockchain, which is expected to solve the problems of poor scalability, key distribution, and non-resistance to quantum attacks. Although the secure multi-party computing technology in the blockchain is still in the development stage, the combination of cryptography and blockchain will become the mainstream development trend in the future.","","978-1-6654-1815-7","10.1109/DSC53577.2021.00008","National Key Technologies R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1402700); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750441","blockchain;secure multi-party computation;privacy protection","Computers;Privacy;Quantum computing;Scalability;Public infrastructure;Packet loss;Market research","blockchains;data privacy","blockchain;secure multiparty computing technology;privacy protection;zero-knowledge proof scheme;secret sharing scheme;homomorphic encryption scheme","","","","36","IEEE","11 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Non-Cooperative Resource Utilization Game Between Two Competing Malware","V. S. Varma; Y. Hayel; I. -C.

These malware infect the nodes in order to exploit their computational resources for specific purposes such as mining crypto-currency, cloud computing, etc. We suppose that each virus spreads following the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) compartmental model. Additionally, we assume that the malware designers can tune the percentage of resource utilization from their host nodes. A higher resource utilization implies a higher instantaneous profit but will also lead to faster detection and elimination (node recovery) of the malware. Once the malware is detected, complete protection of the infected node by means of anti-malware software is also possible at a smaller rate. The proposed setup results in a non-cooperative game between the two players (the malware designers) trying to maximize their profit i.e., the resources utilized from the infected nodes. We characterize and analyze the Nash equilibrium for such a game using a time-scale separation approximation. Finally, we numerically validate the approximation and we compute the price of anarchy.","2475-1456","","10.1109/LCSYS.2022.3186620","ANR(grant numbers:NICETWEET ANR-20-CE48-0009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9807350","Computer networks;game theory;compartmental models","Malware;Games;Computational modeling;Resource management;Viruses (medical);Computer viruses;Statistics","cloud computing;computer viruses;game theory;resource allocation","digital nodes;computational resources;mining crypto-currency;cloud computing;susceptible-infected-susceptible compartmental model;host nodes;infected node;anti-malware software;two competing malware;noncooperative resource utilization game;SIS;Nash equilibrium;time-scale separation approximation","","3","","14","IEEE","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This trend has significantly increased the risk of malicious interference with car components, vehicles and infrastructure, and cybersecurity defences have generally proven to be lacking. The success of, and trust in, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) relies upon these security gaps being closed as soon as possible. To this end, Crypta Labs introduced a novel electronic control unit (ECU) prototype for enabling secure digital communication in the transport domain. Due to its novelty, it is a challenge to evaluate its functionality, robust and reliable for automotive platforms. In this paper, we introduce the novel ECU, apply a testing methodology specially adapted to this product to achieve the evaluation goal, and conclude with a discussion.","","978-1-7281-0888-9","10.1109/ICSTW.2019.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8728946","Automotive, Security, Testing, ECU, Quantum Random Number Generator, Testbeds, Denial of Service (DoS)","Cryptography;Prototypes;Cameras;Testing;Software;Light sources","automotive components;automotive electronics;digital communication;interference (signal);mechanical engineering computing;security of data","QRNG ECU;automotive security;automotive components;malicious interference;car components;security gaps;Crypta Labs;secure digital communication;automotive platforms;cybersecurity;connected and autonomous vehicles;electronic control unit prototype","","6","","19","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
