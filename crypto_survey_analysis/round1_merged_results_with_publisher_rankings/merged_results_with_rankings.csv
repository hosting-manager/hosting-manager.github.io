In this Bitcoin trend analysis work, initial attributes are considered from five sectors based on financial, social, token, network, and that count to thirteen attributes. The thirteen attributes considered are price, volume, market cap, a mean dollar invested age, social volume, social dominance, development activity, transaction volume, token age consumed, token velocity, token circulation, market value to realized value, and realized cap. We apply the attribute selection and trend analysis mapped with potential seven attributes: Price, Volume, Market Cap, Social Dominance, Development Activity, Market Value to Realized Value & Realized Cap. We have conducted Nonlinear Autoregressive with External Input analysis considering seven attributes. The work employed three training algorithms to train a neural network as Levenberg-Marquard, Bayesian Regularization, and Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm. The Error histogram and regression plots results indicate that the Bayesian Regularized Neural Network is showing good performance and thus provides a better forecast."

a comparative study of bitcoin price prediction using deep learning,"ji s., kim j., im h.",mathematics,2019,10.3390/math7100898,bitcoin; blockchain; cryptocurrency; deep learning; predictive model; time series analysis,65,Journal,Check Further,"Bitcoin has recently received a lot of attention from the media and the public due to its recent price surge and crash. Correspondingly, many researchers have investigated various factors that affect the Bitcoin price and the patterns behind its fluctuations, in particular, using various machine learning methods. In this paper, we study and compare various state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as a deep neural network (DNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a convolutional neural network, a deep residual network, and their combinations for Bitcoin price prediction. Experimental results showed that although LSTM-based prediction models slightly outperformed the other prediction models for Bitcoin price prediction (regression), DNN-based models performed the best for price ups and downs prediction (classification). In addition, a simple profitability analysis showed that classification models were more effective than regression models for algorithmic trading. Overall, the performances of the proposed deep learning-based prediction models were comparable. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

a complete vader-based sentiment analysis of bitcoin (btc) tweets during the era of covid-19,"pano t., kashef r.",big data and cognitive computing,2020,10.3390/bdcc4040033,correlation; covid-19; sentiment analysis; twitter; vader scoring,34,Journal,Q2,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many research studies have been conducted to examine the impact of the outbreak on the financial sector, especially on cryptocurrencies. Social media, such as Twitter, plays a significant role as a meaningful indicator in forecasting the Bitcoin (BTC) prices. However, there is a research gap in determining the optimal preprocessing strategy in BTC tweets to develop an accurate machine learning prediction model for bitcoin prices. This paper develops different text preprocessing strategies for correlating the sentiment scores of Twitter text with Bitcoin prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the effect of different preprocessing functions, features, and time lengths of data on the correlation results. Out of 13 strategies, we discover that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices. The prices only correlate well with sentiment scores over shorter timespans. Selecting the optimum preprocessing strategy would prompt machine learning prediction models to achieve better accuracy as compared to the actual prices. © 2020 by the authors.

Recently, researchers have aimed to improve the performance of price prediction methods by applying deep learning-based models. However, most studies have focused on predicting cryptocurrency prices for the following day. Therefore, clients are inconvenienced by the necessity of rapidly making complex decisions on actions that support maximizing their profit, such as “Sell”, “Buy”, and “Wait”. Furthermore, very few studies have explored the use of deep learning models to make recommendations for these actions, and the performance of such models remains low. Therefore, to solve these problems, we propose a deep learning model and three input features: sellProfit, buyProfit, and maxProfit. Through these concepts, clients are provided with criteria on which action would be most beneficial at a given current time. These criteria can be used as decision-making indices to facilitate profit maximization. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, daily price data of six representative cryptocurrencies were used to conduct an experiment. The results confirm that the proposed model showed approximately 13% to 21% improvement over existing methods and is statistically significant. © 2022 by the authors.

According to authoritative literature, the occurrence of diabetes may be related to a person's age, living environment, living habits, genes, past medical history and other factors. We can get more accurate models through machine learning training on a large amount of data, but in order to protect patients' private information between different hospitals, it is impossible to conduct training directly through data transmission. In view of this situation, we propose a solution combining homomorphic encryption and federated learning, and design and implement a privacy-protected diabetes prediction system based on federated learning. The experimental results demonstrated that it broke the phenomenon of information isolation among hospitals and successfully collected patient information from different hospitals, which could not only improve the accuracy of the trained model, but also effectively protect the privacy of patients. Therefore, this work is very innovative and practical, and has strong practical and application significance under the current social background.

During the ICO process, whitepapers are important not only as promotional material through which ventures can demonstrate the technical and financial project details but also as references for investors. Persuasion theory and the related literature suggest that the presentation and order of information have a significant impact on the attitude of the audience. Therefore, in addition to projects’ metadata features, we construct a document analysis deep regression model (DADRM) to innovatively extract deep text and layout features from whitepapers. Based on a real-life dataset, we conduct a comparative study to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework in predicting ICO success in terms of the funding amount. The empirical results show that our model that both extracts text content and retains the original 2D structure of the document can significantly reduce prediction error. Based on our proposed model, both ICO platforms and investors can prejudge the funding amount of cryptocurrency projects and mitigate information asymmetry.

Nowadays, cryptocurrency trade constitutes one of the most popular and promising type of profitable investments. Nevertheless, this new and constantly increasing financial market is characterized by high volatility and strong fluctuations of prices over time. As a result, it is considered essential for portfolio optimization and management, the development of a forecasting model. In this work, we propose a new time-series model based on dropout weight-constrained recurrent neural networks for forecasting cryptocurrency prices and the value of Crypto-Currency index 30 (CCi30). The proposed forecasting model exploits advanced regularization techniques for reducing the fundamental problem of overfitting. More specifically, it is characterized by the imposition of box-constraints on the weights of the network for reducing the likelihood of them blowing up to unrealistic values. Additionally, the adoption of dropout technique aims to explore hard-reaching regions of the weight space and forces the weights to away from zero. The proposed forecasting model was evaluated against state-of-the-art types of neural networks and regression models for forecasting the price of the four most widely traded digital currencies and for the prediction of CCi30 index. Our conducted experimental and detailed statistical analysis demonstrate that although weight-constrained networks give significant improvements the adoption of dropout technique in weight-constrained networks provides a boost in increasing the forecasting performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature."

This study aims to investigate how the Korean government has developed and implemented regulatory policies. Methods/Statistical analysis: This study draws on documentary research. Various documents were used, mainly including government publications, research papers, and trend analysis reports. Documentary research was an appropriate method in this research. F irstly, there has not been enough attention to this research topic, which needed to acquire contextualized knowledge before carrying out empirical research. Secondly, performing empirical research was not feasible at the time of this research due to fast-changing technical elements. Findings: To effectively control misuse of cryptocurrencies, the Korean government has developed and enforced regulatory policies . The government policies were manifestations of an interdepartmental approach initiated by the higher government. However, those regulatory policies were not based upon any comprehensive regulatory framework tailored to cryptocurrencies. Also, two strands of regulatory strategies were adopted. The first strategy focused on regulating cryptocurrency exchanges. T hose exchanges were found to be the least regulated by the government unlike comparable financial exchanges. This approach could be effective in that individual users were required to use traditional banking services when buying and selling cryptocurrencies. The second strategy depended on the pre-existing financial regulatory framework by utilizing public financial institutions. This traditional regulatory framework included watchdog agencies, banks, and credit card companies. The financial regulatory framework also set the b oundary for relevant policies of nonfinancial institutions. In this respect, non-financial institutions involved did not have a clear presence in the framework, while public financial institutions' role was extensive enough to put pressure on cryptocurren cy exchanges. Improvements/Applications: The governmental approach to cryptocurrencies needs to be revamped over time because the contextual factors change constantly. It needs to incorporate government's responses as well as market trends. © 2018 Authors."

The results show that our hybrid model has a similar predictive performance in terms of MSE, MAE and RMSE but higher metric scores in precision, accuracy and F1 score under optimal hyperparameters. This study reveals that the combination of parametric models like GARCH with deep neural network may come up with better results in cryptocurrency price forecasting especially in the case of highly volatile data or when short data sequences are available. Moreover, the proposed framework can be used also in other applications where high volatility and scarcity of data are the main characteristics."

Prediction is based on cipher features such as the number of rounds, permutation pattern, and truncated differences. Experiments are performed on a simplified generalised Feistel structure (GFS) block cipher. Prediction accuracy is optimised by refining how cipher features are represented as training data, and tuning hyperparameters. Results show that the machine learning classifiers are able formulate a relationship between the cipher features and security.

These currencies are Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Our study considers the pre-COVID-19 and ongoing COVID-19 periods. An algorithm that allows updated data analysis, based on the use of a sensor in the database, is also proposed. The results show strong evidence that the SVM is a robust technique for devising profitable trading strategies and can provide accurate results before and during the current pandemic. Our findings may be helpful for different stakeholders in understanding the cryptocurrency dynamics and in making better investment decisions, especially under adverse conditions and during times of uncertain environments such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

a new cryptojacking malware classifier model based on dendritic cell algorithm,"ahmad a., shafiuddin w., kama m.n., saudi m.m.",acm international conference proceeding series,2019,10.1145/3387168.3387218,artificial intelligence; cryptojacking; cyber security; dendritic cell algorithm; malware,2,Conference,CORE - A*,"A new threat known as ""cryptojacking"" has entered the picture where cryptojacking malware is the future trend for cyber criminals, who infect victim's device, install cryptojacking malware, and use the stolen resources for crytocurrency mining. Worse comes to worst by 2020, researchers estimate there will be 30 billion of IoT devices in the world. IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks because of their simple configuration, unpatched vulnerability and weak passwords. IoT devices also prone to be poorly monitored because of their nature. There is lack of studies that provide in depth analysis on cryptojacking malware classification using machine learning approach where the current research mostly focused on manual analysis of web-based cryptojacking attacks. As IoT devices requires small processing capability, a lightweight model are required for the cryptojacking malware detection algorithm to maintain its accuracy without sacrificing the performance of other process. As a solution, we propose a new lightweight cryptojacking classifier model based on machine learning technique that may fit in a low processing capability environment such as IoT and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). This paper aim to disscuss a new approach based on dendritic cell algorithm in order to provide a lightweight cryptojacking classifier model. The output of this paper will be significant used in detecting cryptojacking malware attacks that benefits multiple industries including cyber security contractors, oil and gas, water, power and energy industries. © 2019 ACM."
a new hybrid cryptocurrency returns forecasting method based on multiscale decomposition and an optimized extreme learning machine using the sparrow search algorithm,"du, xx; tang, zp; wu, jc; chen, kj; cai, y",ieee access,2022,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3179364,predictive models; cryptocurrency; forecasting; data models; prediction algorithms; time series analysis; solid modeling; cryptocurrency; model selection; decomposition-ensemble; extreme learning machine; sparrow search algorithm,0,Journal,Q1,"The return series of cryptocurrencies, which are emerging digital assets, exhibit nonstationarity, nonlinearity, and volatility clustering compared to other traditional financial markets, making them exceptionally difficult to forecast. Therefore, accurate cryptocurrency price forecasting is essential for market participants and regulators. It has been demonstrated that improved data forecasting accuracy can be achieved through decomposition, but few researchers have performed information extraction on the residual series generated by data decomposition. Based on the construction of a decomposition-optimization-integration hybrid model framework, in this paper, we propose a multi-scale hybrid forecasting model that combines the residual components after primary decomposition for secondary decomposition and integration. This model uses the variational modal decomposition (VMD) method to decompose the original return series into a finite number of components and residual terms. Then, the residual terms are decomposed, and the features are extracted using the completed ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) method. The components are predicted by an extreme learning machine optimized by the sparrow search algorithm, and the final predictions are summed to obtain the final results. Forecasts for the returns of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are significant cryptocurrency assets, are compared with other benchmark models constructed based on different ideas. We find that the proposed quadratic decomposition VMD-Res.-CEEMDAN-SSA-ELM hybrid model demonstrates the optimal and most stable forecasting performance in both one-step and multi-step ahead prediction of the cryptocurrency return series."

Firstly, this paper presents a study of the severe drawbacks of all existing literature on FTS. In particular, this article outlines severe shortcomings of all existing FTS based algorithms that caused inaccuracies among all existing FTS-based algorithms in yielding meaningful prediction. Then, a novel structure of our improvised FTS, denoted as QFTS, is presented in this paper, which aims to rectify all flaws exist in all conventional FTS based models in literature. A further hybrid of QFTS with ANN is also presented. Later, a comparative analysis of all the aforementioned FTS models is presented in terms of overall forecasting accuracy and forecasting accuracy under specific conditions. The results are being compared in terms of MAPE. The newly invented QFTS model and the QFTS-ANN hybrid is found to profoundly outperform all the existing FTS models in literature, which includes Singh's FTS model.

a new privacy-preserving framework based on edge-fog-cloud continuum for load forecasting,s. hou; h. li; c. yang; l. wang,2020 ieee wireless communications and networking conference (wcnc),2020,10.1109/WCNC45663.2020.9120680,,1,Conference,CORE - B,"As an essential part to intelligently fine-grained scheduling, planning and maintenance in smart grid and energy internet, short-term load forecasting makes great progress recently owing to the big data collected from smart meters and the leap forward in machine learning technologies. However, the centralized computing topology of classical electric information system, where individual electricity consumption data are frequently transmitted to the cloud center for load forecasting, tends to violate electric consumersâ privacy as well as to increase the pressure on network bandwidth. To tackle the tricky issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework based on the edge-fog-cloud continuum for smart grid. Specifically, 1) we gravitate the training of load forecasting models and forecasting workloads to distributed smart meters so that consumersâ raw data are handled locally, and only the forecasting outputs that have been protected are reported to the cloud center via fog nodes; 2) we protect the local forecasting models that imply electricity features from model extraction attacks by model randomization; 3) we exploit a shuffle scheme among smart meters to protect the data ownership privacy, and utilize a re-encryption scheme to guarantee the forecasting data privacy. Finally, through comprehensive simulation and analysis, we validate our proposed privacy-preserving framework in terms of privacy protection, and computation and communication efficiency."
a non-cooperative resource utilization game between two competing malware,v. s. varma; y. hayel; i. -c. morärescu,ieee control systems letters,2023,10.1109/LCSYS.2022.3186620,computer networks;game theory;compartmental models,0,Journal,Q1,"In this letter, we consider a population of digital nodes (such as phones, computers, etc.) that are under the attack of two competing malware. These malware infect the nodes in order to exploit their computational resources for specific purposes such as mining crypto-currency, cloud computing, etc. We suppose that each virus spreads following the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) compartmental model. Additionally, we assume that the malware designers can tune the percentage of resource utilization from their host nodes. A higher resource utilization implies a higher instantaneous profit but will also lead to faster detection and elimination (node recovery) of the malware. Once the malware is detected, complete protection of the infected node by means of anti-malware software is also possible at a smaller rate. The proposed setup results in a non-cooperative game between the two players (the malware designers) trying to maximize their profit i.e., the resources utilized from the infected nodes. We characterize and analyze the Nash equilibrium for such a game using a time-scale separation approximation. Finally, we numerically validate the approximation and we compute the price of anarchy."
a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (narx) neural network model for the prediction of timestamp influence on bitcoin value,n. aljojo; a. alshutayri; e. aldhahri; s. almandeel; a. zainol,ieee access,2021,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124629,bitcoin (digital currency);volume of btc;bitcoin;timestamp,0,Journal,Q1,"The transaction and market of bitcoin is volatile, meaning itâs uncertain because it changes frequently. There have been a number of research studies that have presented bitcoin price prediction models, but none of them have looked at the controlling variables linked with bitcoin transaction timestamps. It might be that price is not the only key criteria influencing bitcoin transactions, or the available model for bitcoin price prediction is yet to consider timestamp as a determining factor in its transaction. A better and more accurate model would be required to predict how the Timestamp influences changes of bitcoin transactions. That is why this current study utilized a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the prediction of timestamp influence on Bitcoin value. Bitcoin historical datasets which are converted to a nonlinear regression into a âwell-formulatedâ statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression are used. Simulation analysis indicates that bitcoin digital currencyâs performance variation is highly influenced by its transaction timestamp with the prediction accuracy of 96%. The contributions of this research lies with the fact that specific Bitcoin transaction events repeat themselves over and over again, meaning that the Open-Price, High-Price, Low-Price, and Close-Price of Bitcoin price over timestamp developed a pattern that was predicted by NARX with less That means those involved in the transaction of bitcoin at the wrong timestamp will certainly face the uncertainty negative effect of the bitcoin market."

Moreover these silent or stealth attacks are characterised by low observability along with bad traceability resulting in their difficulty detection, traceability and prevention. Due to the nature of silent or stealth attacks that have difficulty detection, traceability and prevention calibre, it means traditional and/or ordinary security mechanisms won't be sufficient to compact such attacks. In turn the nearby remedy to tackle these attacks is to incorporate method(s) that can curb trends that has hidden patterns.

As a way to offer maximum security when dealing with these sophisticated kinds of attacks, a conjuncture of cryptography will also be fused in the proposed model. A logical series of actions will be executed such that once a possible attack is sensed, then a proactive action is triggered to avoid an invasion by this attack.

In this paper, we propose a system for predicting home ownership using machine learning, i.e. whether the user is likely to be a homeowner or a renter, on the basis of the user's demographic data, in a way that preserves the user's privacy while making the predictions. Our system uses differential private data perturbation along with homomorphic encryption of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors as the privacy preservation technique to mask the real identities of the users whose home ownership data is predicted. Our trained model is used for prediction on a sample dataset of a few thousand users.

Due to its vulnerable characteristics, different types of research have been conducted to accomplish the task of predicting future FOREX currency prices accurately. In this research, we present a comprehensive review of the recent advancements of FOREX currency prediction approaches. Besides, we provide some information about the FOREX market and cryptocurrency market. We wanted to analyze the most recent works in this field and therefore considered only those papers which were published from 2017 to 2019. We used a keyword-based searching technique to filter out popular and relevant research. Moreover, we have applied a selection algorithm to determine which papers to include in this review. Based on our selection criteria, we have reviewed 39 research articles that were published on ""Elsevier"", ""Springer"", and ""IEEE Xplore"" that predicted future FOREX prices within the stipulated time. Our research shows that in recent years, researchers have been interested mostly in neural networks models, pattern-based approaches, and optimization techniques. Our review also shows that many deep learning algorithms, such as gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short term memory (LSTM), have been fully explored and show huge potential in time series prediction. © 2020 by the authors."

Numerous machine learning approaches were used for effective early disease prediction. However, machine learning takes more time and less performance while classification. In this research work, the Attribute based Searchable Honey Encryption with Functional Neural Network (ABSHE-FNN) framework is proposed to analyze the disease and provide stronger security in IoT-cloud healthcare data. In this work, the Cardiovascular Disease and Pima Indians diabetes dataset are used for heart and diabetic disease classification. Initially, means-mode normalization removes the noise and normalizes the IoT data, which helps to enhance the quality of data. Rectified Linear Unit (RLU) was applied to adjust the feature weight to reduce the training cost and error classification. This proposed ABSHE-FNN technique provides better security and achieves 92.79% disease classification accuracy compared to existing techniques. © 2022 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved."

advanced social media sentiment analysis for short-term cryptocurrency price prediction,wołk k.,expert systems,2020,10.1111/exsy.12493,cryptocurrencies; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media; speculative models,22,Journal,Q3,"In recent years, the scrutiny of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal and regulated components of financial systems has been increasing. Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices.

advanced turbidity prediction for operational water supply planning,"stevenson m., bravo c.",decision support systems,2019,10.1016/j.dss.2019.02.009,analytics; turbidity prediction; water quality,21,Journal,Q1,"Turbidity is an optical quality of water caused by suspended solids that give the appearance of ‘cloudiness'. While turbidity itself does not directly present a hazard to human health, it can be an indication of poor water quality and mask the presence of parasites such as Cryptosporidium. It is, therefore, a recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) that turbidity should not exceed a level of 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) before chlorination. For a drinking water supplier, turbidity peaks can be highly disruptive requiring the temporary shutdown of a water treatment works. Such events must be carefully managed to ensure continued supply; to recover the supply deficit, water stores must be depleted or alternative works utilised. Machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective for the modelling of complex environmental systems, often used to help shape environmental policy. We contribute to the literature by adopting such techniques for operational purposes, developing a decision support tool that predicts >1 NTU turbidity events up to seven days in advance allowing water supply managers to make proactive interventions. We apply a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and a Random Forest (RF) model for the prediction of >1 NTU events. AUROC scores of over 0.80 at five of six sites suggest that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting turbidity peaking events. Furthermore, we find that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost due to its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Since key points are random and sparse, their randomness needs to be investigated to predict key points reliably. Based on measure theory, we propose an event mapping model to formally define this randomness and express it in a low dimensional and normalized space Q through mapping functions. Interestingly, when mapping functions are monotonic, the probability of a key event can be approximated by those of nested random events in Q. Based on this finding, we designed a long short-term memory based neural network to learn the mapping functions and derived an asymptotic statistical learning (ASL) algorithm. ASL automatically analyzes the convergence of random events in space Q and makes point estimates on key events in trading. Compared with 12 existing algorithms on six real datasets from NYSE, S&P 500, NASDAQ, cryptocurrency markets, etc., the algorithm ASL reliably predicts sparse key events from many random events, which provides a method to deal with the imbalance classification problem in predicting key events in trading. ASL significantly outperforms other algorithms under different market situations in both bull and bear markets. © 2001-2011 IEEE."

While this highly volatile market offers great profit opportunities to investors, it also brings risks due to its sensitivity to speculative news and the unpredictable behaviour of major investors that can cause unsual price movements. In this paper, we argue that rapid and high price fluctuations or unusual patterns that occur in this way may negatively affect the functionality of technical signals that constitute a basis for feature extraction in a machine learning (ML)-based trading system and this may cause the generalization of the model to deteriorate. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end ML-based trading system including a time series outlier detection module that detects the periods in which unusual price formations are observed. The training of the classification algorithms for the price direction prediction task was performed on the remaining data. We present the results related to the accuracy of the classification models as well as the simulation results obtained using the proposed system for real time trading on the historical data. The findings showed that the outlier detection step significantly increases return on investment for the machine learning-based trading strategies. Besides, the results showed that during the highly volatile periods the trading system becomes more profitable compared to the baseline model and buy&hold strategy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

The race between the increasing complexity of strong PUF structures and the increasing capability of modeling strong PUFs with fewer resources for training is still ongoing. In this work, we evaluate a new technique to use Transfer Learning to model strong delay-based PUF using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as the probabilistic model. Transfer Learning has been already proposed for modeling strong PUF with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Here we propose Transfer Learning for MLP, since MLP models are relatively less complex and can be trained potentially with less training data. We exploit the reusability of weight values in the hidden dense layers of an MLP model in an existing domain, to further decrease the required resources in training an MLP in another domain. Here a domain represents the the CRP space of a given strong PUF instance. We support our proposed Transfer Learning method with simulated data of some variants of XOR Arbiter PUF.

The limited supply, high volatility, and random price fluctuations have increased investors' interest in BTC, especially in daily trading. Although BTC has been yielding a high rate of returns, price fluctuations and constant speculations make the investors wary of unexpected price movements. Predictive modeling suffers from the complexity of the datasets (i.e., the high number of features employed to forecast BTC movements) as well as the black-box nature of most machine learning algorithms (which is especially problematic for corporate investors since they are obligated to disclose their investment decisions to their clients). Therefore, the main goal of the current study is to assist individual and corporate investors in making transparent and interpretable daily BTC trading decisions by developing a predictive analytics framework. To address the complexities posed by the datasets, a comprehensive tri-level feature selection approach is proposed. The selected features are then, fed into the Classification & Regression Tree (C&RT) to build a highly parsimonious, transparent, and interpretable prediction model. The resultant model was not only evaluated on the test (holdout) sample but was also tested on challenging time periods, including the first half of 2020 (the start of the pandemic era) to exhibit the viability and reliability of the proposed framework. Finally, a decision support tool is developed for the practical implementation of the model. The tool can be used by short-term investors not only due to its highly simplistic, transparent, and interpretable structure, but also its higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity results when compared to the extant literature. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
an optimized support vector machine (svm) based on particle swarm optimization (pso) for cryptocurrency forecasting,"hitam n.a., ismail a.r., saeed f.",procedia computer science,2019,10.1016/j.procs.2019.12.125,artificial intelligence; cryptocurrency; machine learning; particle swarm optimization; support vector machines,28,Conference,Journal - Unranked,"Forecasting accurate future price is very important in financial sector. An optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is introduced in forecasting the cryptocurrency future price. It is part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses previous experience to forecast future price. Analysts and investors generally combine fundamental and technical analysis prior to decide the best price to execute their trades. Some may use Machine Learning Algorithms to execute their trades. However, forecasting result using basic SVM algorithms does not really promising. On the other hands, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is known as a better algorithm for a static and simple optimization problem. Therefore, PSO is introduced to optimize the algorithms of SVM in cryptocurrency forecasting. The experiment of selected cryptocurrencies is conducted for this classifier. The experimental result demonstrates that an optimized SVM-PSO algorithm can effectively forecast the future price of cryptocurrency thus outperforms the single SVM algorithms. © 2019 The Authors.

analysing speech for clinical applications,"trancoso, i; correia, j; teixeira, f; raj, b; abad, a","statistical language and speech processing, slsp 2018",2018,10.1007/978-3-030-00810-9_1,pathological speech; data mining; cryptography,2,Conference,Unranked,"The boost in speech technologies that we have witnessed over the last decade has allowed us to go from a state of the art in which correctly recognizing strings of words was a major target, to a state in which we aim much beyond words. We aim at extracting meaning, but we also aim at extracting all possible cues that are conveyed by the speech signal. In fact, we can estimate bio-relevant traits such as height, weight, gender, age, physical and mental health. We can also estimate language, accent, emotional and personality traits, and even environmental cues. This wealth of information, that one can now extract with recent advances in machine learning, has motivated an exponentially growing number of speech-based applications that go much beyond the transcription of what a speaker says. In particular, it has motivated many health related applications, namely aiming at non-invasive diagnosis and monitorization of diseases that affect speech. Most of the recent work on speech-based diagnosis tools addresses the extraction of features, and/or the development of sophisticated machine learning classifiers [5,7,12-14,17]. The results have shown remarkable progress, boosted by several joint paralinguistic challenges, but most results are obtained from limited training data acquired in controlled conditions. This talk covers two emerging concerns related to this growing trend. One is the collection of large in-the-wild datasets and the effects of this extended uncontrolled collection in the results [4]. Another concern is how the diagnosis may be done without compromising patient privacy [18]. As a proof-of-concept, we will discuss these two aspects and show our results for two target diseases, Depression and Cold, a selection motivated by the availability of corresponding lab datasets distributed in paralinguistic challenges. The availability of these lab datasets allowed us to build a baseline system for each disease, using a simple neural network trained with common features that have not been optimized for either disease. Given the modular architecture adopted, each component of the system can be individually improved at a later stage, although the limited amount of data does not motivate us to exploit deeper networks. Our mining effort has been focused on video blogs (vlogs), that include a single speaker which, at some point, admits that he/she is currently affected by a given disease. Retrieving vlogs with the target disease involves not only a simple query (i.e. depression vlog), but also a post-filtering stage to exclude videos that do not correspond to our target of first person, present experiences (lectures, in particular, are relatively frequent). This filtering stage combines multimodal features automatically extracted from the video and its metadata, using mostly off-the-shelf tools. We collected a large dataset for each target disease from YouTube, and manually labelled a small subset which we named the in-the-Wild Speech Medical (WSM) corpus. Although our mining efforts made use of relatively simple techniques using mostly existing toolkits, they proved effective. The best performing models achieved a precision of 88% and 93%, and a recall of 97% and 72%, for the datasets of Cold and Depression, respectively, in the task of filtering videos containing these speech affecting diseases. We compared the performance of our baseline neural network classifiers trained with data collected in controlled conditions in tests with corresponding in-the-wild data. For the Cold datasets, the baseline neural network achieved an Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 66.9% for the controlled dataset, and 53.1% for the manually labelled subset of the WSM corpus. For the Depression datasets, the corresponding values were 60.6%, and 54.8%, respectively (at interview level, the UAR increased to 61.9% for the vlog corpus). The performance degradation that we had anticipated for using in-the-wild data may be due to a greater variability in recording conditions (p.e. microphone, noise) and in the effects of speech altering diseases in the subjects' speech. Our current work with vlog datasets attempts to estimate the quality of the predicted labels of a very large set in an unsupervised way, using noisy models. The second aspect we addressed was patient privacy. Privacy is an emerging concern among users of voice-activated digital assistants, sparkled by the awareness of devices that must be always in the listening mode. Despite this growing concern, the potential misuse of health related speech based cues has not yet been fully realized. This is the motivation for adopting secure computation frameworks, in which cryptographic techniques are combined with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Privacy in speech processing is an interdisciplinary topic, which was first applied to speaker verification, using Secure Multi-Party Computation, and Secure Modular Hashing techniques [1,15], and later to speech emotion recognition, also using hashing techniques [6]. The most recent efforts on privacy preserving speech processing have followed the progress in secure machine learning, combining neural networks and Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) [3,8,9]. In this work, we applied an encrypted neural network, following the FHE paradigm, to the problem of secure detection of pathological speech. This was done by developing an encrypted version of a neural network, trained with unencrypted data, in order to produce encrypted predictions of health-related labels. As proof-of-concept, we used the same two above mentioned target diseases, and compared the performance of the simple neural network classifiers with their encrypted counterparts on datasets collected in controlled conditions. For the Cold dataset, the baseline neural network achieved a UAR of 66.9%, whereas the encrypted network achieved 66.7%. For the Depression dataset, the baseline value was 60.6%, whereas the encrypted network achieved 60.2% (67.9% at interview level). The slight difference in results showed the validity of our secure approach. This approach relies on the computation of features on the client side before encryption, with only the inference stage being computed in an encrypted setting. Ideally, an end-to-end approach would overcome this limitation, but combining convolutional neural networks with FHE imposes severe limitations to their size. Likewise, the use of recurrent layers such as LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory) also requires a number of operations too large for current FHE frameworks, making them computationally unfeasible as well. FHE schemes, by construction, only work with integers, whilst neural networks work with real numbers. By using encoding methods to convert real weights to integers we are throwing away the capability of using an FHE batching technique that would allow us to compute several predictions, at the same time, using the same encrypted value. Recent advances in machine learning have pushed towards the quantization and discretization of neural networks, so that models occupy less space and operations consume less power. Some works have already implemented these techniques using homomorphic encryption, such as Binarized Neural Networks [10,11,16] and Discretized Neural Networks [2]. The talk will also cover our recent efforts in applying this type of approach to the detection of health related cues in speech signals, while discretizing the network and maximizing the throughput of its encrypted counterpart. More than presenting our recent work in these two aspects of speech analysis for medical applications, this talk intends to point to different directions for future work in these two relatively unexplored topics that were by no means exhausted in this summary."

Therefore the intelligent management and under-standing the characteristics of cryptocurrencies are becoming more interesting. The price of cryptocurrencies are characterized by linear and nonlinear trend, seasonality and high volatility, which increases the risk factors for investors. This study ex-periments with three different time series forecasting methods, specifically considered for Cryptocurrencies price such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR) and Cardano (XRP), and devises a procedure to evaluate their performance. Time series data are collected and examined using descriptive statistics. In next step, the White Neural Network is used for Non-Linearity and Dickey-Fuller for nonstationary and correlation among different settings of datasets. Based on these analyses, we evaluate efficient financial forecasting models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric, Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal (TBATS) and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) with reference to different parameters configuration of these models. The performance is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) criterion and models are ranked by statistical mean and standard deviation of MAPE values. The NNAR model gives minimum MAPE of 2.823 while the minimum convergence time of 4.9835s is observed with TBATS and hence, these are ranked at top amongst other models respectively. These results underpin that neural network-based models perform equally well on both types of nonlinear and linear financial data and, thus, have the potential to improve the impact of financial transaction and cryptocurrencies price bringing more innovation in the decision making process. © 2022 IEEE."

Accurate Diagnosis of cancer is essential in treating it properly. Medical tests regarding cancer in recent times are quite expensive and not available in many parts of the world. CryptoNets, on the other hand, is an exhibit of the use of Neural-Networks over data encrypted with Homomorphic Encryption. This project demonstrates the use of Homomorphic Encryption for outsourcing neural-network predictions in case of Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL). By using CryptoNets, the patients or doctors in need of the service can encrypt their data using Homomorphic Encryption and send only the encrypted message to the service provider (hospital or model owner). Since Homomorphic Encryptions allow the provider to operate on the data while it is encrypted, the provider can make predictions using a pre-trained Neural-Network while the data remains encrypted all throughout the process and finally sending the prediction to the user who can decrypt the results. During the process the service provider (hospital or the model owner) gains no knowledge about the data that was used or the result since everything is encrypted throughout the process. Our work proposes a Neural Network model which will be able to predict ALL-Acute Lymphoid Leukemia with approximate 80% accuracy using the C_NMC Challenge dataset. Prior to building our own model, we used the dataset and pre-process it using a different approach. We then ran on different machine learning and Neural Network models like VGG16, SVM, AlexNet, ResNet50 and compared the validation accuracies of these models with our own model which lastly gives better accuracy than the rest of the models used. We then use our own pre-trained Neural Network to make predictions using CryptoNets. We were able to achieve an encrypted prediction of about 78% which is close to what we achieved when validating our own CNN model that has a validation accuracy of 80% for prediction of Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL). © Science and Information Organization."

In this work, we present concretely-eficient protocols for secure 3-party computation (3PC) over a ring of integers modulo 2 tolerating one corruption, both with semi-honest and malicious security. Owing to the fact that computation over ring emulates computation over the real-world system architectures, secure computation over ring has gained momentum of late. Cast in the offline-online paradigm, our constructions present the most eficient online phase in concrete terms. In the semi-honest setting, our protocol requires communication of 2 ring elements per multiplication gate during the online phase. In the malicious setting, our protocol requires communication of 4 elements per multiplication gate during the online phase, beating the state-of-the-art protocol by 5 elements. Realized with both the security notions of selective abort and fairness, the malicious protocol with fairness involves a slightly more communication than its counterpart with abort security for the output gates alone. We apply our techniques from 3PC in the regime of secure server-aided machine-learning (ML) inference for a range of prediction functions-linear regression, linear SVM regression, logistic regression, and linear SVM classification. Our setting considers a model-owner with trained model parameters and a client with a query, with the latter willing to learn the prediction of her query based on the model parameters of the former. The inputs and computation are outsourced to a set of three non-colluding servers.

This paper investigated the forecasting capability of the Transformer model on Bitcoin (BTC) price data and Ethereum (ETH) price data which are time series with high fluctuation. Long short term memory model (LSTM) is employed for performance comparison. The result shows that LSTM performs better than Transformer both on BTC and ETH price prediction. Furthermore, in this paper, we also investigated if sentiment analysis can help improve the model's performance in forecasting future prices. Twitter data and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) is used for getting sentiment scores. The result shows that the sentiment analysis improves the Transformer model's performance on BTC price but not ETH price. For the LSTM model, the sentiment analysis does not help with prediction results. Finally, this paper also shows that transfer learning can help on improving the Transformer's prediction ability on ETH price data."
automated dynamic detection of ransomware using augmented bootstrapping,m. sukul; s. a. lakshmanan; r. gowtham,2022 6th international conference on trends in electronics and informatics (icoei),2022,10.1109/ICOEI53556.2022.9777099,ransomware;mitigation method;api calls;n-grams;behavior model;decision making,0,Conference,IEEE Sponsored,"Ransomware is a subset of malware that blocks the access of infected computers by encrypting the user files and locking the screen. To restore the computer's functionality and user files, the malware demands a ransom, which must be paid in the form of cryptocurrency within a stipulated period. The deleterious effects caused by ransomware must be detected and addressed promptly. It is often difficult to perceive the metrics and parameters to look for, particularly when conducting experiments with unfamiliar ransomware variants. Traditionally, analysis carried out on these suspicious files can be categorized as static or dynamic based analysis. Static-based signature analysis is tremendously affected because of its nature of generating hard-coded policies or rules. Attackers often attempt to breach them by employing various techniques like code obfuscation, encryption, packaging, etc. While the dynamic analysis provides more insights into the analyzed files. The proposed work observes the behavioral aspects of ransomware and builds a generic model using machine learning techniques to detect the variants of ransomware families. Such threats must be detected early, i.e., before encryption takes place. Early detection, however, is hampered by a lack of sufficient information in the early stages of an attack, which leads to low detection accuracy and a high rate of false alarms. Currently, available solutions assume that there is complete knowledge of the behavior of such attacks at the time of detection, but that is not the case. The same is not true for early detection which takes place during an attack when the data are not fully accessible. Our paper proposes a novel technique to address these limitations called Augmented Bootstrapping and this method analyses the API calls made by the ransomware along with their timestamps. These timestamps indicate the API call sequences, which in turn help in constructing the N-gram model. The names of API calls are concatenated together to generate the bigram, trigram, 4-gram, and 5-gram models. Further, TF-IDF scores will be calculated for each of these N-grams sequences, and a machine learning model will be trained based on these values. The method analyses API call sequences of each of the active applications in the system and confirms the ransomware attack when it matches a malicious call sequence pattern. Our empirical results confirm that the proposed work could detect ransomware attacks with high accuracy and fewer false predictions."

Furthermore, considering the latest trends in the attack scenarios and crypto-currency based intrusions, security has become a major problem for high performance computing. Therefore, to address both challenges, in this paper we present an autonomic management methodology for both security and power/performance. Our proposed approach first builds knowledge of the environment in terms of power consumption and the security tools' deployment. Next, it provisions virtual resources so that the power consumption can be reduced while maintaining the required performance and deploy the security tools based on the system behavior.

Due to this, sentiment analysis of the cryptocurrency-related comments has become highly desirable to give a comprehensive picture of peoples' opinions about the trend of the market. In this regard, we perform cryptocurrency-related text sentiment classification using tweets based on positive and negative sentiments. For increasing the efficacy of the sentiment analysis, we introduce a novel deep neural network hybrid architecture which is composed of an embedding layer, a convolution layer, a group-wise enhancement mechanism, a bidirectional layer, an attention mechanism, and a fully connected layer. Local features are derived using a convolution layer, and weight values associated with intuitive features are developed using the group-wise enhancement mechanism. After feeding the improved context vector to the bidirectional layer to grab global features, the attention mechanism and the fully connected layer have been employed.

Since its inception, in a short period of time Bitcoin got wide popularity and considered as an investment asset. At present it is the most successful cryptocurrency compared to other altcoins dispersed in the world economy. The Bitcoin prices fluctuate like other stock markets due to inherent volatility. The investors’ confidence on Bitcoin rising fast and have been reflected on its prices. Though few computational intelligence methods are available, sophisticated methodologies for accurate prediction of Bitcoin are still lacking and need to be explored. Functional link neural network (FLN) is a flat network, offers lower computational complexity, and achieves enhanced input–output nonlinearity mapping through functional expansion of input signals. Basis functions such as Legendre, Trigonometric, Laguerre, and Chebyshev are commonly used polynomials in FLN for expansion of input signal dimension. In this article along with the weight and bias vector of FLNs, optimal number of polynomial functions for each category of basis function is selected by genetic algorithm during training process rather fixing them earlier. Therefore, an optimal FLN structure is crafted on fly from exploitation of training data. The optimal FLN models are used to predict the daily, weekly, and monthly closing prices of Bitcoin. A comparative study among optimal FLNs is carried out using evaluation metrics such as MAPE, NMSE, ARV, and U of Theil’s statistics. Finally, outcomes from experimental and comparative studies suggested the superiority of optimal FLN models for Bitcoin closing price prediction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol.

We have tried to accomplish this by using a series of deep learning techniques and methodologies. Our decision to build this model using LSTM was based on the comparison of results between other algorithms like CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). Unlike technical analysis methods which are used for normal stock market prediction we have built a model which will be trained to classify news headlines based on the sentiment detected and give a predicted price.

bitcoin transaction strategy construction based on deep reinforcement learning,"liu f., li y., li b., li j., xie h.",applied soft computing,2021,10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107952,bitcoin; deep reinforcement learning; high-frequency trading strategies; proximal policy optimization,3,Journal,Q1,"The emerging cryptocurrency market has lately received great attention for asset allocation due to its decentralization uniqueness. However, its volatility and brand new trading mode has made it challenging to devising an acceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm — proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning. Visualizations of trading the process show how the model handles high-frequency transactions to provide inspiration and demonstrate that it can be expanded to other financial products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

An automated pattern recognition decentralizes and distributes customized specific data. Machine learning, originated from artificial intelligence is primarily related to recognition of behavior patterns. Methods like knowledge discovery in database (KDD) and data mining focus on unsupervised approaches and are widely used in business and climatic weather applications. Blockchain addresses data-security concerns and builds trust by creating distributed ledger. Theft, willful fraud, software and hardware are considered by blockchain in data protection. Blockchain has greater significant feature as it makes the secure data access without enabling the central management entity. Two design features of blockchain technology help in this task. Recommended customer data pattern recognition technique using blockchain may eliminate all these problems. Two kinds of cryptographic algorithms employed in blockchain are asymmetric-key algorithms and hash functions. The current study analyzes the asymmetric cryptography approach along with key pair which supports in system security. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier techniques consider both old customers and new customers as stable. The predictive model aids in identifying customers at churn risk in the telecommunication system. Existing proactive methods are unable to explain difficulties in customer interaction understanding and meeting their genuine needs.

C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time - rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16%.

Traditional PLA schemes exploiting channel state information (CSI) face significant challenges in mobile communication scenarios due to the unknown variation of wireless channels. To address this challenge, we propose a PLA scheme based on Gaussian process (GP) channel prediction, where the variation of channel characteristics is tracked and predicted. Specifically, historical CSI attributes together with the transmitter's geographical information are exploited to establish a mapping to predict the next legitimate CSI for authentication. Furthermore, to overcome the impracticality of applying conventional PLA framework for authentication, where an unrealistic assumption that either the prior knowledge of the adversary's statistical channel model or even the real observations of its CSI data is required, we propose the so-called one-class authentication (OCA) scheme, which does not require any attacker's channel information. We exploit the quasideterministic radio channel generator (QuaDRiGa) simulation platform as the generator of CSI for experimental verifications. Simulation tests are performed to demonstrate that our method improves authentication performance significantly in time-varying scenarios. © 2014 IEEE."

characterizing linux-based malware: findings and recent trends,"carrillo-mondéjar j., martínez j.l., suarez-tangil g.",future generation computer systems,2020,10.1016/j.future.2020.04.031,data analytics; embedded systems; expert systems; iot; machine learning; malware forensics,5,Journal,Q1,"Malware targeting interconnected infrastructures has surged in recent years. A major factor driving this phenomenon is the proliferation of large networks of poorly secured IoT devices. This is exacerbated by the commoditization of the malware development industry, in which tools can be readily obtained in specialized hacking forums or underground markets. However, despite the great interest in targeting this infrastructure, there is little understanding of what the main features of this type of malware are, or the motives of the criminals behind it, apart from the classic denial of service attacks. This is vital to modern malware forensics, where analyses are required to measure the trustworthiness of files collected at large during an investigation, but also to confront challenges posed by tech-savvy criminals (e.g., Trojan Horse Defense). In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of Linux-based malware. Our study is tailored to IoT malware and it leverages automated techniques using both static and dynamic analysis to classify malware into related threats. By looking at the most representative dataset of Linux-based malware collected by the community to date, we are able to show that our system can accurately characterize known threats. As a key novelty, we use our system to investigate a number of threats unknown to the community. We do this in two steps. First, we identify known patterns within an unlabeled dataset using a classifier trained with the labeled dataset. Second, we combine our features with a custom distance function to discover new threats by clustering together similar samples. We further study each of the unknown clusters by using state-of-the-art reverse engineering and forensic techniques and our expertise as malware analysts. We provide an in-depth analysis of what the most recent unknown trends are through a number of case studies. Among other findings, we observe that: i) crypto-mining malware is permeating the IoT infrastructure, ii) the level of sophistication is increasing, and iii) there is a rapid proliferation of new variants with minimal investment in infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

The market for NFTs exploded in 2021, and much of the public is being exposed to this new digital ownership medium for the first time. While uptake of this new medium is relatively slow, we feel the prospects of blockchain technology are up-and-coming. NFTs are still largely misunderstood by the wider community, and as such, this provides a fascinating opportunity to explore the NFT marketplace in greater depth. We analyzed sales data from OpenSea - the NFT marketplace with the most extensive user base and sales volume. Our study considered 5.25 million sales that occurred between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. We first lead by presenting an overview of our data collection process and summarizing key statistics of the data set. We examine user behaviour in the market to show that a small subset of heavy-hitters is driving massive growth. Secondly, we review the economic activity within the network to show how these power users drive extreme price volatility within the Art and Collectible categories. Lastly, we review the network of buyers and sellers to show that despite the sparsity that exists in the network, communities of users are forming, and most power users tend to congregate in these structures. These findings shed light on areas of the NFT marketplace that have been relatively unexamined and provide a multi-level analysis of a multi-billion dollar market. © 2022 ACM."

A chatbot is the extension of human interface mediums such as the phone and social platforms. Similarly, Cryptocurrency is a new extension of digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. In the current digital exchanging world, investors and interested parties are eager to know more information about, and the capabilites of, this new type of currency. One of the potential paths to retrieve the info automatically and quickly is through a chatbot. We explored the open source python library, Chatterbot, to apply Itchat API (a WeChat interface) with the aim of building a robot chatting application, IC Chat, on the topic of cryptocurrency. First, we collected question and answer pairs datasets from Quora websites. Furthermore, we also created API calls to query the real time quote for the top 25 cryptocurrencies. Then we used the collected data to train our chatbot and implemented a logic adapter to receive the price quote of cryptocurrencies based on the incoming question. The Itchat API method will return the best matched answer to the asking party automatically. The response time of different questions has been investigated. The results imply that this application is quite useful, feasible and beneficial to the digital currency world. © 2019 IEEE."

Transcriptomic analysis of blood samples has emerged as a potential means to identify biomarkers and gene signatures of PD. In this context, classification algorithms can assist in detecting data patterns such as phenotypes and transcriptional signatures with potential diagnostic application. In this study, we performed gene expression meta-analysis of blood transcriptome from PD and control patients in order to identify a gene-set capable of predicting PD using classification algorithms. We examined microarray data from public repositories and, after systematic review, 4 independent cohorts (GSE6613, GSE57475, GSE72267 and GSE99039) comprising 711 samples (388 idiopathic PD and 323 healthy individuals) were selected. Initially, analysis of differentially expressed genes resulted in minimal overlap among datasets. To circumvent this, we carried out meta-analysis of 17,712 genes across datasets, and calculated weighted mean Hedges' g effect sizes. From the top-100- positive and negative gene effect sizes, algorithms of collinearity recognition and recursive feature elimination were used to generate a 59-gene signature of idiopathic PD. This signature was evaluated by 9 classification algorithms and 4 sample size-adjusted training groups to create 36 models. Of these, 33 showed accuracy higher than the non-information rate, and 2 models built on Support Vector Machine Regression bestowed best accuracy to predict PD and healthy control samples. In summary, the gene meta-analysis followed by machine learning methodology employed herein identified a gene-set capable of accurately predicting idiopathic PD in blood samples. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
clustering and modelling of the top 30 cryptocurrency prices using dynamic time warping and machine learning methods,"šťastný t., koudelka j., bílková d., marek l.",mathematics,2022,10.3390/math10193672,arima; cluster analysis; cryptocurrency; dynamic time warping; machine learning,0,Journal,Check Further,"Cryptocurrencies are a new field of investment opportunities that has experienced a significant growth in the last decade. The crypto market was capitalized at more than USD 3000 bn, having grown from USD 10 m over the period 2011–2021. Generating high returns, investments in cryptocurrencies have also shown high levels of price volatility. By comparing the performance of cryptocurrencies (measured by the crypto index) and standard equities (included in the S&P 500 index), we found that the former has outperformed the latter 14 times over the last two years. In the present paper, we analyzed the 2012–2022 global crypto market developments and main constituents. With a focus on the top 30 cryptocurrencies and their prices, as of 9 April 2022, covering data of the two major market stress events—outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020) and the Russian invasion of Ukraine (February 2022). We applied the dynamic time warping method including barycentre averaging and k-Shape clustering of time series. The use of the dynamic time warping has been essential for the preparation of data for subsequent clustering and forecasting. In addition, we compared performance of cryptocurrencies and equities. Cryptocurrency time series are rather short, sometimes involving high levels of volatility and including multiple data gaps, whereas equity time series are much longer and well-established. Identifying similarities between them allows analysts to predict crypto prices by considering the evolution of similar equity instruments and their responses to historical events and stress periods. Moreover, we tested various forecasting methods on the 30 cryptocurrencies to compare traditional econometric methods with machine learning approaches. © 2022 by the authors."
cnn-based multivariate data analysis for bitcoin trend prediction,"cavalli s., amoretti m.",applied soft computing,2021,10.1016/j.asoc.2020.107065,blockchain; cnn; financial indicators; sentiment analysis,26,Journal,Q1,"Bitcoin is the most widely known blockchain, a distributed ledger that records an increasing number of transactions based on the bitcoin cryptocurrency. New bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that the demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Actually, the price is highly volatile, because it is affected by many factors including the supply of bitcoin, its market demand, the cost of the mining process, as well as economic and political world-class news. In this work, we illustrate a novel approach for bitcoin trend prediction, based on the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). First, we propose a methodology for building useful datasets that take into account social media data, the full blockchain transaction history, and a number of financial indicators. Moreover, we present a cloud-based system characterized by a highly efficient distributed architecture, which allowed us to collect a huge amount of data in order to build thousands of different datasets, using the aforementioned methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses 1D CNN for bitcoin trend prediction. Remarkably, an efficient and low-cost implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNN models that perform one-dimensional convolutions (i.e., scalar multiplications and additions). We show that the 1D CNN model we implemented, trained, validated and tested using the aforementioned datasets, allow one to predict the bitcoin trend with higher accuracy compared to LSTM models. Last but not least, we introduce and simulate a trading strategy based on the proposed 1D CNN model, which increases the profit when the bitcoin trend is bullish and reduces the loss when the trend is bearish. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

We use hidden Markov model performing four different experiments in two-coin markets. We show that market events such as closing price and trading volume are important predictors for the coin market behavior, but not equally in all experiments. Interestingly, hidden Markov process demonstrates that social media metrics fairly explain the future behavior of the coin markets.

Collision resistant hash functions are one of the more useful cryptographic primitives both in theory and in practice and two prominent applications are in signature schemes and succinct zero-knowledge arguments. In this work we consider a relaxation of the above requirement that we call Multi-CRH: a function where it is hard to find x(1), x(2), ..., x(k) which are all distinct, yet h(x(1)) = h(x(2)) = center dot center dot center dot = h(x(k)). We show that for some of the major applications of CRH functions it is possible to replace them by the weaker notion of a Multi-CRH, albeit at the price of adding interaction: we show a constant-round statistically-hiding commitment scheme with succinct interaction (committing to poly(n) bits requires exchanging (O) over tilde (n) bits) that can be opened locally (without revealing the full string). This in turn can be used to provide succinct arguments for any NP statement. We formulate four possible worlds of hashing-related assumptions (in the spirit of Impagliazzo's worlds). They are (1) Nocrypt, where no one-way functions exist, (2) Unihash, where one-way functions exist, and hence also UOWHFs and signature schemes, but no Multi-CRH functions exist, (3) Minihash, where Multi-CRH functions exist but no CRH functions exist, and (4) Hashomania, where CRH functions exist. We show that these four worlds are distinct in a black-box model: we show a separation of CRH from Multi-CRH and a separation of Multi-CRH from one-way functions."

Volatility measures the variation of a time series data, and thus it is also a driving factor for the risk forecasting of returns from investment in cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is a decentralized medium of exchange that relies on cryptographic primitives to facilitate the trustless transfer of value between different parties. Instead of being physical money, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries on an online ledger called blockchain that describe specific transactions.Many commonly used risk forecasting models do not take into account the uncertainty associated with the volatility of an underlying asset to obtain the risk forecasts. Some tools from the fuzzy set theory can be incorporated into the forecasting models to account for this uncertainty. Interest in the use of hybrid models for fuzzy volatility forecasts is growing. However, a major drawback is that the fuzzy coefficient hybrid models used in fuzzy volatility forecasts are not data-driven. This paper uses fuzzy set theory with data-driven volatility and data-driven neuro-volatility forecasts to study the fuzzy risk forecasts. The study focuses on long-term volatility forecasts with daily price data while briefly exploring forecasting models with high-frequency (hourly) data as an avenue for future research. Simple yet effective models incorporating fuzziness to obtain fuzzy risk volatility forecasts and fuzzy VaR forecasts are presented. The key underlying idea, unlike the existing risk forecasting, is the use of a hybrid nonlinear adaptive fuzzy model for volatility."

Instead of deploying an expensive transmitter on OBU, we choose to use smartphone to transfer data through cellular network, which can be communicated with OBU equipped with a cheaper Bluetooth transmitter. To achieve privacy, we design an efficient protocol among OBU, smartphone, and back-end server by using some cryptographic techniques. Compare with the traditional OBU with 3G module (231 USD), the OBU we use is much cheaper (44.6 USD). Our protocol is also efficient enough to be deployed in practice."

Bitcoin was introduced as the first cryptocurrency to allow direct online payments without relying on centralized financial entities. The use of Bitcoin has vastly grown as a financial asset rather than just a tool for online payments. A lot of cryptocurrencies have been created since 2011 with Bitcoin dominating the cryptocurrencies' market. With plenty of cryptocurrencies being used as financial assets and with millions of trades being executed through different exchange services, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to trading problems and challenges similar to those traditionally encountered in the financial domain. Price and trend prediction, volatility prediction, portfolio construction and fraud detection are some examples related to trading. In addition, there are other challenges that are specific to the domain of cryptocurrencies such as mining, cybersecurity, anonymity and privacy. In this paper, we survey the application of artificial intelligence techniques to address these challenges for cryptocurrencies with their vast amount of daily transactions, trades and news that are beyond human capabilities to analyze and learn from. This paper discusses the recent research work done in this emerging area and compares them in terms of used techniques and datasets. It also highlights possible research gaps and some potential areas for improvement. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Identification of such relations is crucial because their existence may be used to create a broad spectrum of analyses and reports about cryptocurrency projects and to obtain a comprehensive outlook of the blockchain domain. The activities on the blockchain reach different levels of anonymity which renders them hard objects of studies. In particular, the standard tools used to characterize social trends and variables that describe cryptocurrencies' situations are unsuitable to be used in the environment that extensively employs cryptographic techniques to hide real users. The employment ofWikipedia to trace crypto assets value need examination because the portal allows gathering of different opinions-content of the articles is edited by a group of people. Consequently, the information can be more attractive and useful for the readers than in case of non-collaborative sources of information. Wikipedia Articles often appears in the premium position of such search engines as Google, Bing, Yahoo and others. One may expect different demand on information about particular cryptocurrency depending on the different events (e.g., sharp fluctuations of price). Wikipedia offers only information about cryptocurrencies that are important from the point of view of language community of the users inWikipedia. This ""filter"" helps to better identify those cryptocurrencies that have a significant influence on the regional markets. The models encompass linkages between different variables and properties. In one model cryptocurrency projects are ranked with the means of articles sentiment and quality. In another model, Wikipedia visits are linked to cryptocurrencies' popularity. Additionally, the interactions between information demand in different Wikipedia language versions are elaborated. They are used to assess the geographical esteem of certain crypto coins. The information about the legal status of cryptocurrency technologies in different states that are offered by Wikipedia is used in another proposed model. It allows assessment of the adoption of cryptocurrencies in a given legislature. Finally, a model is developed that joins Wikipedia articles editions and deletions with the social sentiment towards particular cryptocurrency projects. The mentioned analytical purposes that permit assessment of the popularity of blockchain technologies in different local communities are not the only results of the paper.

This work proposes the use of Mamdani interpretable fuzzy inference models for forecasting cryptocurrency price variation. For that, a genetic algorithm to optimize models accuracy is employed, limiting the quantity of rules and antecedents arbitrarily. A set of infeasible rules had to be discarded, in order to generate interesting models, that produce a relevant amount of trades. Data from Kraken exchange were utilized for training, validation and results assessment. Results have shown that, for the cryptocurrencies with the highest validation performances, there are gains in comparison to the simple currency appreciation. Using the interpretable aspect of the models, it should be possible to obtain even higher profits."

We construct a database containing eight key characteristics on 238 cryptocurrency exchanges and employ machine learning techniques to predict whether a cryptocurrency market will remain active or whether it will go out of business. Both in-sample and out-of-sample measures of forecasting performance are computed and ranked for four popular machine learning algorithms. Although all four models produce satisfactory classification accuracy, our best model is a random forest classifier. It reaches accuracy of 90.4% on training data and 86.1% on a test dataset. From the list of predictors, we find that exchange lifetime, transacted volume, and cyber-security measures such as security audit, cold storage, and bug bounty programs rank high in terms of feature importance across multiple algorithms.

Since cryptocurrency malware threats perform a legal process, it is a challenging task to detect this type of threat by a manual or heuristic method. In this paper, we propose a novel deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) learning model for hunting cryptocurrency malware threats. Specifically, our proposed model utilizes the RNN to analyze Windows applications’ operation codes (Opcodes) as a case study. We collect a real-world dataset that comprises of 500 cryptocurrency malware and 200 benign-ware samples, respectively. The proposed model trains with five different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) structures and is evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) technique. The obtained results prove that a 3-layer configuration model gains 98% of detection accuracy, which is the highest rate among other current configurations.

In this study, we use advanced artificial intelligence frameworks of fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to analyse the price dynamics of Bitcoin, Etherum, and Ripple. We find that ANN tends to rely more on long-term history while LSTM tends to rely more on short-term dynamics, which indicate the efficiency of LSTM to utilise useful information hidden in historical memory is stronger than ANN. However, given enough historical information ANN can achieve a similar accuracy, compared with LSTM. This study provides a unique demonstration that Cryptocurrency market price is predictable.

Firstly, numerals and historical datasets of Bitcoins are used for all three models, which are further extended to Twitter and news datasets. An error score of 1015.17, 1106.71, and 3010.63 is obtained. Then, the proposed models are applied to the combined dataset of Twitter and news from Ethereum, and an error score of 47.85, 34.01, and 58.27 is obtained. Finally, the same methodology is applied to the combined dataset of Litecoin and obtained an error score of 9.45, 8.81, and 15.94. It is observed that LSTM with GRU generates the best results for all the datasets. © 2022 ACM."

cryptocurrency pump and dump schemes: quantification and detection,f. victor; t. hagemann,2019 international conference on data mining workshops (icdmw),2019,10.1109/ICDMW.2019.00045,cryptocurrencies;manipulation;trading,4,Conference,Unranked,"In the past years, cryptocurrencies have received a lot of attention in popular media. Having attracted significant speculation, prices have soared in 2017, fell in 2018 and are generally known to be very volatile. However, some of the price changes have been due to organized manipulation. Traditionally known in the world of penny stocks and made illegal in most countries, pump and dump schemes are frequent in cryptocurrencies, and mostly unregulated. In this paper, we perform quantification and detection of pump and dump schemes that are coordinated through Telegram chats and executed on Binance - one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. We detail how pumps are organized on Telegram, and quantify the properties of 149 confirmed events with respect to market capitalization, trading volume, price impact and profitability. Based on this ground truth, and regular trading intervals obtained from twitter timestamps, we optimize a binary classifier in order to be able to detect additional suspicious trading activity. Our results indicate that pump and dump schemes occur frequently in cryptocurrencies with market capitalizations below $50 million, that scheme operators often organize their actions across multiple channels, that such activity tends to lead to inflated prices over longer time periods and machine learning can help to identify activity that is similar to known pump and dump schemes."
cryptocurrency volatility forecasting: a markov regime-switching midas approach,"ma f., liang c., ma y., wahab m.i.m.",journal of forecasting,2020,10.1002/for.2691,bitcoin; jump driven time-varying transition probabilities; markov-switching model; midas; realized variance,27,Journal,Q2,"The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate whether a novel Markov regime-switching mixed-data sampling (MRS-MIADS) model we design can improve the prediction accuracy of the realized variance (RV) of Bitcoin. Moreover, to verify whether the importance of jumps for RV forecasting changes over time, we extend the standard MIDAS model to characterize two volatility regimes and introduce a jump-driven time-varying transition probability between the two regimes. Our results suggest that the proposed novel MRS-MIDAS model exhibits statistically significant improvement for forecasting the RV of Bitcoin. In addition, we find that jump occurrences significantly increase the persistence of the high-volatility regime and switch between high- and low-volatility regimes. A wide range of checks confirm the robustness of our results. Finally, the proposed model shows significant improvement for 2-week and 1-month horizon forecasts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

It is also necessary to examine its evolution and activity over time to statistically analyze its possible future behavior. Both retail and institutional investors base their trading strategies on these analyses. One of the most used techniques to study financial time series is to analyze its dynamic structure using auto-regressive models, simple moving average models (SMA), and mixed auto-regressive moving average models (ARMA). These techniques, unfortunately, do not always provide appreciable results both at a statistical level and as the Risk-Reward Ratio (RRR); above all, each system has its pros and cons. In this paper, we present CryptoNet; this system is based on the time series extraction exploiting the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Specifically, we focused on time series trends extraction by developing an artificial neural network, trained and tested on two famous crypto-currencies: Bitcoinand Ether.

Therefore, privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) aims at providing privacy using techniques such as secure multi-party computation (SMPC). Recent years have seen a rapid influx of cryptographic frameworks that steadily improve performance as well as usability, pushing PPML towards practice. However, as it is mainly driven by the crypto community, the PPML toolkit so far is mostly restricted to well-known neural networks (NNs). Unfortunately, deep probabilistic models rising in the ML community that can deal with a wide range of probabilistic queries and offer tractability guarantees are severely underrepresented. Due to a lack of interdisciplinary collaboration, PPML is missing such important trends, ultimately hindering the adoption of privacy technology. In this work, we introduce CryptoSPN, a framework for privacy-preserving inference of sum-product networks (SPNs) to significantly expand the PPML toolkit beyond NNs. SPNs are deep probabilistic models at the sweet-spot between expressivity and tractability, allowing for a range of exact queries in linear time. In an interdisciplinary effort, we combine techniques from both ML and crypto to allow for efficient, privacy-preserving SPN inference via SMPC. We provide CryptoSPN as open source and seamlessly integrate it into the SPFlow library (Molina et al., arXiv 2019) for practical use by ML experts. Our evaluation on a broad range of SPNs demonstrates that CryptoSPN achieves highly efficient and accurate inference within seconds for medium-sized SPNs. © 2020 ACM."

Worst by 2020, researchers estimate there will be 30 billion of IoT devices in the world. Majority of the devices are highly vulnerable to simple attacks based on weak passwords and unpatched vulnerabilities and poorly monitored. Thus it is the best projection that IoT become a perfect target for cryptojacking malwares. There are lacks of study that provide in depth analysis on cryptojacking malware especially in the classification model. As IoT devices requires small processing capability, a lightweight model are required for the cryptojacking malware detection algorithm to maintain its accuracy without sacrificing the performance of other process. As a solution, we propose a new lightweight cryptojacking classifier model based on instruction simplification and machine learning technique that can detect the cryptojacking classification algorithm. This research aims to study the features of existing cryptojacking classification algorithm, to enhanced existing algorithm and to evaluate the enhanced algorithm for cryptojacking malware classification.

Fuzzy set theory has a unique ability to quantitatively and qualitatively model and analyze such problems. Volatility forecasting plays an important role in financial risk management and in option pricing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in data-driven volatility models and neurovolatility models for risk forecasting of stocks and index funds. However, even these state-of-the-art models do not take into account the fuzzy volatility in their risk forecasts.Cryptocurrencies are a novel financial asset class based on the Blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity among retail investors as a financial asset with high risks and high returns. The extremely volatile nature of cryptocurrencies (compared to traditional assets) makes forecasting their volatility more challenging. A simple algorithmic trading approach, Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy, is used to calculate the Algo returns. This paper provides fuzzy forecasts of the volatility of Algo returns using the data-driven Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (DD-EWMA) and neuro models for six major cryptocurrencies. We also compute and compare fuzzy volatility forecasts of four major tech stocks and Chicago Board Options Exchangeâs (CBOE) volatility index (VIX) using DD-EWMA and neuro models.

Due to attractiveness of Bitcoin in terms of returns and risk, Bitcoin price prediction is attracting a growing attention from both investors and researchers. Indeed, with the development of machine learning and especially deep learning, forecasting Bitcoin is receiving a particular interest. Methods We implement and apply deep forward neural network (DFFNN) for the analysis and forecasting Bitcoin high-frequency price data. Importantly, we seek to investigate the effect of standard numerical training algorithms on the accuracy obtained by DFFNN; namely, the conjugate gradient with Powell-Beale restarts, the resilient algorithm, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The DFFNN was applied to a big dataset composed of 65,535 samples. Results In terms of root mean of squared errors (RMSEs), the simulation results show that the DFFNN trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm outperforms DFFNN trained with Powell-Beale restarts algorithm and DFFNN trained with resilient algorithm. In addition, the resilient algorithm is fast which suggests that it could be promising in online training and trading. Conclusions The DFFNN trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is effective and easy to implement for Bitcoin high-frequency price data forecasting."

detecting early warning signals of major financial crashes in bitcoin using persistent homology,m. s. ismail; s. i. hussain; m. s. m. noorani,ieee access,2020,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3036370,cryptocurrencies;bitcoin;persistent homology;critical transition;early warning signals,6,Journal,Q1,"This study explores persistent homology to detect early warning signals of the 2017 and 2019 major financial crashes in Bitcoin. Sliding window is used to obtain point cloud datasets from a multidimensional time series (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple). We apply persistent homology to quantify transient loops that appear in multiscale topological spaces, which associated on each point cloud dataset and encode the quantified information in a persistence landscape. Temporal changes in persistence landscapes are measured via their L1-norms. Consequently, a new representative is attained, called L1-norms time series. The L1-norms is associated with indicators: autocorrelation function at lag 1, variance and mean power spectrum at low frequencies to detect the signals. By using Kendall's tau correlation and significance test, significant rising trend events that occur before major financial crashes in Bitcoin are defined as the signals. A threshold is determined to scan entire data and record all the significant rising trend events. Lastly, we compare L1-norms with residuals time series, which is another representative obtained from de-trending approach. Our result portrays that autocorrelation function at lag 1 and variance of the L1-norms successfully detect early warning signals before the 2017 and 2019 major financial crashes. However, variance of the L1-norms is better since it able to signal another 2018 major financial crash. For the residuals, no early warning signals are detected. Hence, persistent homology provides a better representative than de-trending approach. Overall, persistent homology is a promising method to detect early warning signals of major financial crashes in Bitcoin."
detection of encrypted malicious network traffic using machine learning,"de lucia, mj; cotton, c",milcom 2019 - 2019 ieee military communications conference (milcom),2019,,network detection; cyber security; machine learning; convolutional neural networks,11,Conference,IEEE Sponsored,"The proliferation of encrypted network traffic necessitates an innovative machine learning traffic analysis approach which does not rely on pattern matching or the payload content of the packets to detect malicious / suspicious communications. Encryption of Internet traffic has increasingly become a typical best practice, making network packet content analysis yield diminishing returns. A majority of internet traffic is now protected using the cryptographic protocol known as Transport Layer Security (TLS). Malware authors have also followed this trend with the use of TLS to hide malicious network communications. We propose a malicious communication detection mechanism using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and an alternative with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Both methods achieve respectable results and a low False Positive Rate (FPR). However, the SVM method outperforms the CNN method in all evaluation metrics presented. Lastly, we propose future work to experiment with transport layer size and direction as features and automate feature engineering by using raw packet traffic with a CNN augmented with a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) for detection of malicious traffic."

As cryptocurrency attracts more and more people's attention, the price of cryptocurrency has reached unprecedented heights, and now IoT devices are likely to become the target of cybercriminals for stealing computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. This paper proposes a method based on machine learning to detect the existence of malicious miners using IoT devices in a local area network. Compared with previous methods that leverage static signatures or dynamic analysis, this method has low overhead, is easy to maintain, and independent of specific IoT devices and manufacturers. We collected normal traffic from 4 different IoT devices and the traffic of an IoT device that mines the Monero cryptocurrency. Based on the collected data set, 5 machine learning models have been trained to classify normal traffic and mining traffic. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively detects IoT device mining traffics. © 2021 IEEE."

A given system makes it possible to guess the trend in an exchange rate fluctuation. Conferences of a particular cryptocurrency, new implementations, government decrees from different countries, affect a trend as well, so it too must be taken into consideration. In order to account for most cases, it is necessary to constantly accumulate information on the subject and to assign it to Tables in a database. A given process takes place using a specialized software bot that collects and indexes information. The system is characterized by the following features that favorably distinguish it from analogs: the speed of page generation; the presence of SSL certificate and TLS encryption; content of better quality as it is updated every minute; there are no inactive sections of the service; the mobile web-site layout does not copy content at subdomain; automated checks against e-mail spam messages on the exchange rate.

As bitcoin received increased attention, researchers have examined popular sentiment as a predictor of bitcoin price fluctuation. However, the popular sentiment may differ from the sentiment of financial professionals. We ask whether the presence and news sentiment from prestigious business journals would affect the bitcoin return. We collected the daily bitcoin price data from 01/01/2017 to 03/31/2018 from the third-party cryptocurrency exchange website CoinMarketCap. The headlines of news mentioning bitcoin on Wall Street Journal and Financial Times are collected from LexisNexis Database. We calculated the sentiment embedded in the news headlines using a bag-of-words model and a dictionary-based approach. We estimate a regression of financial news sentiment on bitcoin daily return. Our main findings are that positive sentiment contributes significantly negatively to bitcoin return on the same day; negative sentiment day contributes positively, although not significantly. We interpret these findings through the disposition effect that, investors tend to sell high-performed assets and hold underperformed assets. The findings extend our understanding of disposition effect to the cryptocurrency market, and we plan to further examine if there is evidence of the disposition effect. © 2019 Association for Information Systems.

Under these circumstances, in countries with cheap or subsidized electricity price, the introduction of profitable cryptocurrencies application is deeply penetrated. It has attracted many low-voltage customers to mine these digital currencies individually or in mining pools. The employed mining devices with their own unique constant load profile have escalated the coincident factor of the loads supplied by a transformer. This can highly overload the transformers engaged with loads of this type and, in the long term will cause destructive impacts not only on the transformer also on the distribution facilities. This paper studies the adverse effect of cryptocurrency mining loads on the distribution transformer aging. At first, the customer's profit analysis through mining operation has been introduced, realizing different electric energy pricing strategies. Finally, 105 real-world distribution substations have been monitored over one year, and their actual load profiles data are recorded for analysis. A relation between the penetration rate of the mining devices and the transformer's expected lifetime is determined in this work. It is shown that the distribution transformers' expected lifetime will decrease by 25% in the presence of only a 5% penetration rate of cryptocurrency miners. This is an alarming statistic for distribution networks operating under the presence of cryptocurrency mining loads. This should be strictly addressed in the future planning of these distribution networks. © 2022 IEEE."

In the empirical application, we construct optimal portfolios, both with and without cryptocurrencies, and evaluate their comparative performance both in- and out-of-sample. A conservative modification of a t-test is presented to test the null hypothesis of non-dominance of an optimal portfolio that includes cryptocurrencies over the traditional portfolio of only stocks, bonds and cash.

This objective requires to specify whether investors can extend their exposure in certain asset classes and benefit their portfolios in a statistically significant way. In this paper, we address this issue of diversification in the context of cryptoasset portfolios and examine whether their risk-adjusted performance can be enhanced through seeking exposure into the commodities class. For an equally-weighted portfolio of five cryptoassets, we first consider the addition of physical gold, as conceptualised by the CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index, a diversified, monthly-rebalanced index that seeks exposure to both asset classes. We further consider modifying the index composition by replacing physical gold with a basket of five commodities. Mean-variance spanning tests reveal that the addition of physical gold in the original cryptoasset portfolio translates to a significant shift in the efficient frontier, both in terms of the global minimum variance and the tangency portfolios. Additionally, expanding the exposure in the commodity side confirms a statistically significant improvement, with the diversification benefit arising from a shift in the tangency portfolio. We further generate a number of price paths for the original index, the modified index and their components, according to a Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH specification, to assess the efficiency of the index weighted risk contribution scheme. Results demonstrate a superior performance of the two indices when compared against their constituents in terms of Omega ratio. The modified index appears more appropriate for investors that seek higher annual returns, while the original composition would be more appropriate for individuals with moderate annual return goals. © 2021 IEEE."

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation. Further, to check the usability of DL-GuesS on other cryptocurrencies, we have also inferred results for price prediction of Bitcoin-Cash with the price history and tweets of Bitcoin-Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin. © 2013 IEEE."

do cryptocurrency prices camouflage latent economic effects? a bayesian hidden markov approach,"koki c., leonardos s., piliouras g.",future internet,2020,10.3390/fi12030059,bayesian modeling; bitcoin; cryptocurrencies; ethereum; forecasting; logistic regression; non-homogeneous hidden markov models; variables selection,1,Journal,Q2,"We study the Bitcoin and Ether price series under a financial perspective. Specifically, we use two econometric models to perform a two-layer analysis to study the correlation and prediction of Bitcoin and Ether price series with traditional assets. In the first part of this study, we model the probability of positive returns via a Bayesian logistic model. Even though the fitting performance of the logistic model is poor, we find that traditional assets can explain some of the variability of the price returns. Along with the fact that standard models fail to capture the statistic and econometric attributes-such as extreme variability and heteroskedasticity-of cryptocurrencies, this motivates us to apply a novel Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov model to these series. In particular, we model Bitcoin and Ether prices via the non-homogeneous Polya-Gamma Hidden Markov (NHPG) model, since it has been shown that it outperforms its counterparts in conventional financial data. The transition probabilities of the underlying hidden process are modeled via a logistic link whereas the observed series follow a mixture of normal regressions conditionally on the hidden process. Our results show that the NHPG algorithm has good in-sample performance and captures the heteroskedasticity of both series. It identifies frequent changes between the two states of the underlying Markov process. In what constitutes the most important implication of our study, we show that there exist linear correlations between the covariates and the ETH and BTC series. However, only the ETH series are affected non-linearly by a subset of the accounted covariates. Finally, we conclude that the large number of significant predictors along with the weak degree of predictability performance of the algorithm back up earlier findings that cryptocurrencies are unlike any other financial assets and predicting the cryptocurrency price series is still a challenging task. These findings can be useful to investors, policy makers, traders for portfolio allocation, risk management and trading strategies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

However, since financial datasets have very low signal-to-noise ratio and are non-stationary, complex models are often very prone to overfitting and suffer from instability issues. Moreover, as various machine learning and data mining tools become more widely used in quantitative trading, many trading firms have been producing an increasing number of features (aka factors). Therefore, how to automatically select effective features becomes an imminent problem. To address these issues, we propose DoubleEnsemble, an ensemble framework leveraging learning trajectory based sample reweighting and shuffling based feature selection. Specifically, we identify the key samples based on the training dynamics on each sample and elicit key features based on the ablation impact of each feature via shuffling. Our model is applicable to a wide range of base models, capable of extracting complex patterns, while mitigating the overfitting and instability issues for financial market prediction. We conduct extensive experiments, including price prediction for cryptocurrencies and stock trading, using both DNN and gradient boosting decision tree as base models. Our experiment results demonstrate that DoubleEnsemble achieves a superior performance compared with several baseline methods."

He later called himself the “Dogefather” as he announced that he would be hosting Saturday Night Live (SNL) on 8 May 2021. By performing sentiment analysis on relevant tweets during the time he was hosting SNL, evidence is found that negative perceptions of Musk’s performance led to a decline in the price of Dogecoin, which dropped 23.4% during the time Musk was on air.

A legitimate file in a whitelist may be represented by its cryptographic hash, such as a hash generated using an SHA1 or MD5 hash function. Due to the fact that any small change to a file in a cryptographic hash results in a completely different hash, a file with a cryptographic hash in a whitelist may no longer be identifiable in the whitelist if the file is modified even by a small amount. This prevents a target file from being identified as legitimate even if the target file is simply a new version of a whitelisted legitimate file. Locality Sensitive Hashing is a state of the art method in big data and machine learning for the scalable application of approximate nearest neighbor search in high dimensional spaces [9]. The identification of executable files which are very similar to known legitimate executable files fits very well within this paradigm. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of applying TLSH [1,2]; Trend Micro's implementation of locality sensitive hashing, to identify files similar to legitimate executable files. We start with a brief explanation of locality sensitive hashing and TLSH. We then proceed with the concept of whitelisting, and describe typical modifications made to legitimate executable files such as security updates, patches, functionality enhancements, and corrupted files. We will also describe the scalability problems posed by all the legitimate executable files available on the Windows OS. We will also show results of similarity testing against malicious files (malwares). Data will be provided on the efficacy and scalability of this approach. We will conclude with a discussion of how this new methodology may be employed in a variety of computer security applications to improve the functionality and operation of a computer system. Examples may include whitelisting, overriding malware detection performed by a machine learning system, identifying corrupted legitimate files, and identifying new versions of legitimate files."

However, fraudulent consumers launch electricity theft cyber attacks by reporting false readings to reduce their bills illegally. These attacks do not only cause financial losses but may also degrade the grid performance because the readings are used for grid management. To identify these attackers, the existing schemes employ machine-learning models using the consumers fine-grained readings, which violates the consumers privacy by revealing their lifestyle. In this article, we propose an efficient scheme that enables the SO to detect electricity theft, compute bills, and monitor load while preserving the consumers privacy. The idea is that SMs encrypt their readings using functional encryption (FE), and the SO uses the ciphertexts to: 1) compute the bills following the dynamic pricing approach; 2) monitor the grid load; and 3) evaluate a machine-learning model to detect fraudulent consumers, without being able to learn the individual readings to preserve consumers privacy. We adapted an FE scheme so that the encrypted readings are aggregated for billing and load monitoring and only the aggregated value is revealed to the SO. Also, we exploited the inner-product operations on encrypted readings to evaluate a machine-learning model to detect fraudulent consumers. The real data set is used to evaluate our scheme, and our evaluations indicate that our scheme is secure and can detect fraudulent consumers accurately with low communication and computation overhead."

Together with mobile, flexible and highly scalable amounts of devices, these structures form the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the Internet of Everything (IoE) and Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). However, the key enabler of this development - wireless communication - comes along with drawbacks in the form of new attack vectors and security threats. Due to the open nature and broadcast characteristic, it is especially prone to miscellaneous cyber-attacks, such as eavesdropping. Just because of this, it is a huge challenge to develop and integrate sound and secure communication between doubtless authenticated entities. Since conventional security depends on complex computations as well as overhead within the communication itself, Physical Layer Security (PhySec) offers a worthwhile solution to face these tasks. Furthermore, the application of Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) such as Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE+) and the Fifth Generation (5G) are capable to overcome the constraints of bandwidth limitations. 5G with its benefits of high data rates, low latency, an operation in almost real-time and the microcell approach, is a promising solution for future industrial networks. Besides that, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables new possibilities to utilize inherent given information of the wireless channel and to train models to predict their behaviour and strengthen the generation of a shared secret between two communicating entities. Within this work, PhySec methods are applied to derive symmetric cryptographic credentials and establish a trustful communication. This is done by using a real-world implementation of an NGMN testbed to evaluate the proposed adaptions. AI in the form of the Linear Regression Algorithm (LRA), is applied to enhance the estimated channel model. The results prove the suitability of Channel-PUFs, the benefits of the AI improvements of the Channel Measurement in the Secret Key Generation (SKG) algorithm and the huge overall potential to secure future industrial and private networks.

This paper presents a performance comparison of two ML algorithms in predicting Ethereum price with non-time series analysis, which are k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and multiple polynomial regression (MPR). The experiment used independent variables from related real-world economic fundamentals such as Dow Jones Index, gold price, oil price, and Ethereum volume. The experiment data was collected from the records from April 2017 until April 2021. For each algorithm, several methods of preprocessing data were used to match all independent data with the dependent data. Three different preprocessing scenarios were also used to find the maximum accuracy model. scenario 1 (feature selection based on correlation matrix), scenario 2 (feature selection based on correlation with the dependent variables and among independent variables), and scenario 3 (scenario 1 extracted with PCA). The performance of the compared methods was evaluated by using MSE and MAE.

Although traditionally trading was done by professionals, nowadays a majority of market participants are market-data processing bots due to their inherent advantages in processing large amounts of data, lack of emotions of fear or greed, and predicting market prices through artificial intelligence. A large number of approaches have been brought forward to tackle this task, many of which rely on specially engineered deep learning methods with a focus on specific market conditions. The general limitation of these approaches, however, is the reliance on customized gradient-based methods which limit the scope of possible solutions and don't necessarily generalize well when solving similar problems. This paper proposes a method which uses neuroevolutionary techniques capable of automatically customizing offspring neural networks, generating entire populations of solutions and more thoroughly exploring and parallelizing potential solutions. Our approach uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve increasingly improved populations of neural networks which, based on sentimental and technical analysis data, efficiently predict future market price movements. The effectiveness of this approach is validated by testing the system on both live and historical trading scenarios, and its robustness is tested on other cryptocurrency and stock markets. Experimental results during a 30-day live-trading period show that this method outperformed the buy and hold strategy by over 260%, even while factoring in standard trading fees. © 2021 ACM."

Recent advances in deep learning have enabled not only the classification of encrypted transits, but classification on a per-packet level. End-to-end deep learning models are becoming increasingly ubiq-uitous given their ease of use, i.e., developers do not need to engineer features, and their apparent versatility. However, deep learning entails black-box models that hinder the capability to debug and explain classifications. Moreover, the computational complexity of deep learning can incur unnecessary latency, which is problematic for real-time classification needs. In this paper, we propose a methodology to interpret black-box, deep learning-based encrypted network traffic classification models, with an attempt to understand the dominant features a classifier is focusing on for a given task. We evaluate our approach on state-of-the-art deep learning classification techniques for encrypted per-packet classification and demonstrate how interpretability can be used to debug and improve the training pipeline while significantly reducing the size of the deep learning model.

Traffic profiles are constructed by machine-learning (ML) algorithms using the series of packet sizes and arrival times of QUIC connections.

This article proposes a method to explore targeted and stealthy FDIAs via adversarial machine learning. We pose FDIAs as sparse optimization problems to achieve initial attack objectives and remain stealthy during attacks. We propose a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the problems and explore additional sparse-state attacks.

In addition, the attack success rate can continue to increase as the number of attack states increases. The proposed attacks demonstrate that attackers can implement attacks that can bypass both bad data detectors and neural network detectors while keeping the initial attack objectives unchanged, which is a critical and urgent security threat in CPS."

It allows a secret to be distributed to n parties such that any t parties learn no information about the secret, whereas any t +1 parties can recover the secret. However, the worst-case recovery guarantees come at the price of O(n(2)) computation cost. This quadratic cost limits its scalability to applications involving only a small number of participants. This paper presents a framework, called FastShare, for designing secret sharing schemes that ensures worst-case security guarantees at a lower computation cost by relaxing the recovery constraint from worst-case to average-case in a statistical sense. In particular, FastShare considers the setup where each party takes part in the recovery process with some probability rho, independently of others. The core idea of FastShare is to construct a 'signal' using the secret and random masks by inserting zeros at judiciously chosen locations, and take its finite field fast Fourier transform (FFT) to generate the shares. We present a scheme designed using FastShare where the judicious zero placement ensures that the shares form a codeword of a locally recoverable code. The locality property along with the FFT allows us to recover the secret with O(n log n) computational complexity, from a 'random' subset of shares of large enough size. We analyze its security and recovery thresholds, and characterize a trade-off between p and the probability of successfully recovering the secret. Further, we carry out numerical simulations to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme for a wide range of values of n."

As a consequence, one of the WSN-related security tasks is to protect them from Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. Machine learning-based systems are the only viable option for these types of attacks, as traditional packet deep scan systems depend on open field inspection in transport layer security packets and the open field encryption trend. Moreover, network data traffic will become more complex due to increases in the amount of data transmitted between WSN nodes as a result of increasing usage in the future. Therefore, there is a need to use feature selection techniques with machine learning in order to determine which data in the DoS detection process are most important. This paper examined techniques for improving DoS anomalies detection along with power reservation in WSNs to balance them. A new clustering technique was introduced, called the CH_Rotations algorithm, to improve anomaly detection efficiency over a WSN’s lifetime. Furthermore, the use of feature selection techniques with machine learning algorithms in examining WSN node traffic and the effect of these techniques on the lifetime of WSNs was evaluated. The evaluation results showed that the Water Cycle (WC) feature selection displayed the best average performance accuracy of 2%, 5%, 3%, and 3% greater than Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Harmony Search (HS), and Genetic Algorithm (GA), respectively. Moreover, the WC with Decision Tree (DT) classifier showed 100% accuracy with only one feature. In addition, the CH_Rotations algorithm improved network lifetime by 30% compared to the standard LEACH protocol. Network lifetime using the WC + DT technique was reduced by 5% compared to other WC + DT-free scenarios. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In this paper, we address the problem of real-time QoE monitoring of HAS, focusing on the detection of re-buffering events and QoE-relevant metrics, for the particular case of YouTube. Given the wide adoption of end-to-end encryption, we resort to machine learning models to predict these metrics directly from the analysis of the encrypted traffic. The salient feature of our approach ViCrypt is its ability to perform QoE predictions in real-time, during the course of an ongoing YouTube streaming session, relying on constant memory, stream-like inputs continuously extracted from the encrypted stream of packets. We show through empirical evaluations that ViCrypt can predict the occurrence of re-buffering events with a time granularity as small as one second with very high accuracy. By aggregating independent predictions, ViCrypt is able to accurately estimate per-video-session QoE-relevant metrics such as initial playback delay, number of re-buffering events and stalling ratio. In this situation, we investigate if a decent prediction performance can also be reached by selecting reduced feature sets based on the relevance of the features. Moreover, we explore the potential of including recurrent features, namely, stalling predictions from past time slots, to improve the prediction performance. © 2019 IEEE."

In this scenario the DSO is interested in exploiting EV charges in terms of flexibility that can be planned in optimized way, especially when it is combined with high penetration of RES. This paper provides evidence that EVs charging sessions, planned using a dedicated forecasting module, can contribute to balance the distribution power network; for this purpose suitable flexibility-enabling technologies developed under the H2020 project SOFIE have been used. Data analysis has pointed out that a proper program of charging sessions could significantly increase self-consumption index; moreover, an optimal scheduling has been validated taking into account realistic constraints for its actual implementation. Finally, the paper shows how the enabling technologies for flexibility exploitation have been implemented and validated; notably, a rescheduling of the charging sessions is allowed through the usage of forecasting techniques as well as the implementation of blockchain technologies for enabling a flexibility marketplace."

Cryptocurrencies price behaviour is still largely unexplored, presenting new opportunities for researchers and economists to highlight similarities and differences with standard financial prices. We compared our results with various benchmarks: one recent work on Bitcoin prices forecasting that follows different approaches, a well-known paper that uses Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily NASDAQ closing prices spanning a 3-year interval and another, more recent paper which gives quantitative results on stock market index predictions. We followed different approaches in parallel, implementing both statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms: the Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model for uni-variate series forecast using only closing prices, and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for multivariate series using both price and volume data. We used two artificial neural networks as well: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). While the entire time series resulted to be indistinguishable from a random walk, the partitioning of datasets into shorter sequences, representing different price ""regimes"", allows to obtain precise forecast as evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) and relative Root Mean Square Error (relativeRMSE). In this case the best results are obtained using more than one previous price, thus confirming the existence of time regimes different from random walks.

This paper investigates different predictors from various markets including Gold, Oil, S&P500, VIX, USDI, Ether and Ripple as well as Bitcoin historical price in predicting one-step-ahead Bitcoin returns. We propose a two-stage forecasting that comprises discrete wavelet transform as the decomposition method and a deep long short-term memory network as the forecasting algorithm. Beside analyzing forecasting for both univariate and multivariate regression, we design a simulated trading system to put the forecasts into practice and analyze the economic profitability of the predictors. In addition, we shed light on the black box method by implementing sensitivity analysis. To investigate the predictors’ efficacy through time and consider the effects of early 2018 price spike, the dataset is split into two periods: (1) prior to and including the spike and (2) after the spike. According to the experiments, it is hard to choose one predictor over the other in the first period. However, in the second period, Gold and Oil show the highest statistical accuracy, while S&P500 is the most profit-making predictor. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

In the early 1990's the so called Fuzzy Time Series were proposed to handle vague and imprecise knowledge in time series data and have since become competitive forecasting models. A common limitation of recent fuzzy time series models is their inability to handle non-stationary data. Thus, in this paper we introduce a Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series (NSFTS). In the proposed method, we employ Non-Stationary Fuzzy Sets, in which perturbation functions are used to adapt the membership function parameters in the knowledge base in response to statistical changes in the time series. The flexibility of the method by means of computational experiments was tested with eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several kinds of concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ SP500 and TAIEX), three real FOREX pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, GBP-USD), and two real cryptocoins exchange rates (Bitcoin-USD and Ethereum-USD). As competitor models the Time Variant fuzzy time series and the Incremental Ensemble were used, these are two of the major approaches for handling non-stationary data sets. The proposed method shows resilience to concept drift, by adapting parameters of the model, while preserving the symbolic structure of the knowledge base. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Since in IoT systems the devices are mostly connected among them, the data exchange is a vital activity in the network. In this kind of networks, not only nonsensitive data exchange is performed, but also sensitive data (digital signatures, login credentials, account numbers, personal images, and so on) are shared. Therefore, new appropriate approaches to encrypt the secret information are highly required. This paper presents an experimental setup of a fractional-chaos based-cryptosystem for ad hoc networks under the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The proposed cryptosystem is composed of a novel chaotic pairing approach between the coordinator node and end-devices nodes to sending data into the network. More specifically, the RF-data of the IEEE 802.15.4 frame is encrypted using a fractional-order encryption key and four iterative steps. It is worth to note that the chaotic key is based on a fractional-order chaotic system, which is derived from the fractional calculus theory. Fractional-order chaotic dynamics are demonstrated using the Lyapunov method and equilibria stability. Next, the experimental validation of the cryptosystem is shown sending an encrypted image between ARM digital platforms and wireless Xbee modules. Several security analyses indicate the proposed encryption scheme has suitable statistical properties, sizeable keyspace, and high sensitivity providing secure communications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Among all security threats, the hardware trojan (HT) inserted into the integrated circuit is one of the most concerns. As a flexible and nondestructive approach, the side-channel analysis techniques are widely used for HT detection. However, noise sensitivity and golden chip dependence make side-channel based approaches face greatly challenge in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel HT detection approach based on Isolation Forest, which provides high precision detection capability, while reducing the dependence of the golden chip. First, we perform special preprocessing, named Main Difference Accumulation (MDA), on the side-channel information to magnify the impacts of HT. Then, we train the isolation forest model using the processed information. During the test phase, the obtained model can score the test data. Finally, we complete the detection of HT based on the score and threshold. Moreover, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to achieve the automatic selection of the threshold in the isolation forest. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, we select the power signal as the side-channel information and insert four different kinds of HTs into the AES-128 crypto core. Results obtained using a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA board show that the accuracy of HT detection can reach 100%, with a 1.13% relative area ratio of the original circuit. © 2020 IEEE."

Offering the first credible incarnation of a digital currency, Bitcoin was based on the principal of peer to peer transactions involving a complex public address and a private key that only the owner of the coin would know. This paper will seek to investigate how the usage and value of Bitcoin is affected by current events in the cyber environment. Is an advancement in the digital security of Bitcoin reflected by the value of the currency and conversely does a major security breech have a negative effect? By analyzing statistical data of the market value of Bitcoin at specific points where the currency has fluctuated dramatically, it is believed that trends can be found. This paper proposes that based on the data analyzed, the current integrity of the Bitcoin security is trusted by general users and the value and usage of the currency is growing. All the major fluctuations of the currency can be linked to significant events within the digital security environment however these fluctuations are beginning to decrease in frequency and severity. Bitcoin is still a volatile currency but this paper concludes that this is a result of security flaws in Bitcoin services as opposed to the Bitcoin protocol itself."
heterogeneous defect prediction based on federated reinforcement learning via gradient clustering,"wang a., zhao y., li g., zhang j., wu h., iwahori y.",ieee access,2022,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3195039,data island; experience replay; federated reinforcement learning; gaussian differential privacy,0,Journal,Q1,"Heterogeneous defect prediction (HDP) refers to using heterogeneous data collected by other projects to build a defect prediction model to predict the software defects in a project. Traditional methods usually involve the measurement of the source project and the target project. However, due to the limitations of laws and regulations, these original data are not easy to obtain, which forms a data island. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) has great advantages in training heterogeneous data and data island. In order to solve the data island and data heterogeneity of HDP, we propose a novel Federated Reinforcement Learning via Gradient Clustering (FRLGC) method in this paper. Firstly, the parameters of the global model are transferred to each dueling deep Q network (dueling DQN) model and each client uses private data to train the dueling model which combines experience replay to increase data efficiency in limited datasets. Secondly, gaussian differential privacy is used to encrypt the model parameters to ensure the privacy and security of the model. Finally, we cluster the clients according to their locally encrypted model parameters and use weighted average to aggregate to create a new global model locally and globally. Experiments on nine projects in three public databases (Relink, NASA and AEEEM) show that FRLGC is superior to the relevant HDP solutions. © 2013 IEEE."
high-efficiency min-entropy estimation based on neural network for random number generators,"lv, n; chen, ty; zhu, sy; yang, j; ma, y; jing, jw; lin, jq",security and communication networks,2020,10.1155/2020/4241713,,3,Journal,Q2,"Random number generator (RNG) is a fundamental and important cryptographic element, which has made an outstanding contribution to guaranteeing the network and communication security of cryptographic applications in the Internet age. In reality, if the random number used cannot provide sufficient randomness (unpredictability) as expected, these cryptographic applications are vulnerable to security threats and cause system crashes. Min-entropy is one of the approaches that are usually employed to quantify the unpredictability. The NIST Special Publication 800-90B adopts the concept of min-entropy in the design of its statistical entropy estimation methods, and the predictive model-based estimators added in the second draft of this standard effectively improve the overall capability of the test suite. However, these predictors have problems on limited application scope and high computational complexity, e.g., they have shortfalls in evaluating random numbers with long dependence and multivariate due to the huge time complexity (i.e., high-order polynomial time complexity). Fortunately, there has been increasing attention to using neural networks to model and forecast time series, and random numbers are also a type of time series. In our work, we propose several new and efficient approaches for min-entropy estimation by using neural network technologies and design a novel execution strategy for the proposed entropy estimation to make it applicable to the validation of both stationary and nonstationary sources. Compared with the 90B's predictors officially published in 2018, the experimental results on various simulated and real-world data sources demonstrate that our predictors have a better performance on the accuracy, scope of applicability, and execution efficiency. The average execution efficiency of our predictors can be up to 10 times higher than that of the 90B's for 106 sample size with different sample spaces. Furthermore, when the sample space is over 22 and the sample size is over 108, the 90B's predictors cannot give estimated results. Instead, our predictors can still provide accurate results.

how can we predict the impact of the social media messages on the value of cryptocurrency? insights from big data analytics,"tandon c., revankar s., palivela h., parihar s.s.",international journal of information management data insights,2021,10.1016/j.jjimei.2021.100035,arima; bitcoin; blockchain; cryptocurrency; dogecoin; price prediction; social media analytics; text mining; time series analysis,22,Journal,Not Found,"Cryptocurrency and blockchain are one of the most beautiful digital transformations occurring around the world. They have changed the orthodox meaning and working of currency as we know it. It is interesting to note how it excites and worries some. The main reason for the popularity of cryptocurrencies is tremendous returns in very little time. Social media platforms like twitter, provide a safe-place where individuals’ can share their thoughts as well as mindsets, which then can be heard and be reciprocated by others. This paper aims to draw a correlation between the hyped tweets and the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin - The Crypto King and Dogecoin - The Memecoin during those times. We also aim to predict the future price values of Bitcoin using its past values. By using cryptocurrencies’ financial data, twitter data, RAPIDS and cuml, a fine line can be drawn between the amount of impact tweets have on people as well as on the market. The tweets on cryptocurrency were segregated and price forecasting was done using augmented dickey fuller test and ARIMA models, 10 future values of bitcoin were predicted with 96% accuracy and 0.0395 average error.Besides, from the investigations above of the authentic cost of BTC, it is perfectly clear that there have been way more steep falls in the history of Cryptocurrencies even before Elon started tweeting about it. Thus, it can clearly be stated that no one person can control the utter volatile world of cryptocurrencies!

Because of its digital nature, Bitcoin cannot be valuated exclusively with fundamental approaches, which is why factors such as investor sentiment have become a common alternative to capture its performance. In this work, we studied whether and how the sale of Bitcoins from the insolvency assets of Mt.Gox, which represent about 1.1% of the current global total, relates to Bitcoin price movements. We used social media sentiment analysis of Twitter data to examine how investors are influenced in their decision to buy or sell Bitcoin when confronted with the trade actions of Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee in charge of the Mt.Gox case. We built a vector error correction model to analyse the long-run relationship between cointegrated variables. Our analysis confirms the positive association of Bitcoin performance with positive Twitter sentiment and tweet volume and the negative association with negative sentiment. We further found empirical evidence that Mt.Gox selloff events have a lasting negative impact on the Bitcoin price and that we can measure this effect by Twitter sentiment and tweet volume. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

With the evolving technological advancements in our day to day life security of personal data is a primary concern for all. Many intruders and hackers are eagerly waiting for personal data of the people which can be used in various means for their works. They always have an eye on the personal information of the people. And the second issue is that diagnosing of diabetes by the doctor will be some time prone to mistakes because it is natural that human makes mistakes but not the machines. So to overcome this issue we develop a hybrid secure algorithm which encrypts the patient personal information which they wish not to share to anyone outside the hospital by crypto AES encryption and hashing using SHA-256 and then storing the data in database which will be accessible only to the patient and the doctor. Together with encryption of the patient personal data and medical data our proposed system will effectively evaluate the data by a trained machine learning model to check whether a person is actually suffering from diabetes or not. We use logistic regression for evaluating the patient medical data to predict the health status so mistakes can be avoided in prediction as the prediction is done by the trained machine. Then doctor can give the treatment depending on the health status. As a result this system will give a sustainable solution to people for safely transmitting their personal data as well as medical data through wireless medium along with diabetes disease prediction. © 2022 IEEE.
hybrid blockchain architecture for cloud manufacturing-as-a-service (cmaas) platforms with improved data storage and transaction efficiency,"hasan m., ogan k., starly b.",procedia manufacturing,2021,10.1016/j.promfg.2021.06.060,blockchain; distributed database; gas price prediction; lstm; regression; smart contracts; time series,4,Conference,Journal - Q2,"Blockchain based decentralized Cloud Manufacturing-as-a-Service (CMaaS) platforms enable customers to gain access to a large capacity of manufacturing nodes over cryptographically secure networks. In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem. © 2021 The Authors.

Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation based topic modeling, we identify discussion topics from the two Blockchain related StackExchange sites. We manually investigated the posts belonging to each topic to understand challenges encountered by the developers. The results of our study revealed that while the ratios of posts on BCS development are increasing, the ratios of posts on mining cryptocurrencies are decreasing. Due to the scarcity of expert blockchain developers, posts on BCS development are more likely to go either answered or encounter more delays than posts on other topics.

Cryptocurrencies draw significant attention from researchers because of their advantages. Although there are several risks (e.g., speculation, 51% attack) related to cryptocurrency, billions of dollars are invested in them, because of their transparency, traceability, low transaction cost, and highly profitable potential. In December 2017, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached almost $20,000.00 per coin. Such short-term, high gain potential attracts many new small investors. However, speculative movements raise many questions related to the safety and privacy of investors, just to name a few. To understand public opinions about cryptocurrency and speculative movements to protect small investors financial interests, sentiment analysis can be done by using social media activities of individuals who are interested or investing in cryptocurrencies. It is also one of the essential steps in the analysis to understand the profiles of the users. Therefore, in this paper, we determine the attitudes of social network users by analyzing the positivity and negativity of the comments about six cryptocurrencies.

This is because of the massive usage of end-to-end security protocols over Internet such as HTTPS and QUIC. The encryption trend will continue to rapidly increase in the future, and this trend concerns video streaming applications as well. Network providers face a serious challenge in managing their networks due to such widespread deployment of end-to-end security protocols. These operators need to have a clear visibility into traffic on their networks to monitor and manage both quality of experience (QoE)-and-service (QoS) impairments in popular video streaming services, in the most effective and efficient manner. Moreover, so many factors that influence QoE need to be taken care of to get an acceptable user experience. Most of the existing solutions use the deep packet inspection to infer these factors from the encrypted traffic. However, these solutions are inefficient, most of the time, leading to low QoE inference accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine-learning based solution that leverages a random forest classifier for a better QoE inference accuracy. The proposed solution uses network-and-transport layer information to infer QoE factors such as startup delay and stall events. It helps the network providers to react quickly and in real time for any impairments in the QoE of the encrypted video traffic. We evaluate our solution using an HTTP adaptive streaming service (YouTube) that uses HTTPS and QUIC protocols. Our experimental results show that our solution achieves up to 91.1% classification accuracy for HTTPS and up to 87.3% for QUIC. © 2020 IEEE."

The market microstructure for bitcoins is highly developed in terms of information generation and transfer. Therefore, returns volatility is highly likely to be affected by market information availability. We analyze the relationship between returns volatility and two independent variables, user opinion difference and user interest. This study adopted the GJR-GARCH model, appropriate for volatility studies. First, we find that, for volatility asymmetry, the Bitcoin market exhibits greater market efficiency than the general financial market. Also, the persistence of volatility is greater. The Bitcoin market is still relatively unregulated; hence, studying the relationship between information asymmetry and regulation in the market is salient. Moreover, we can infer that the ratio of reasonable users is high in the Bitcoin market. Second, the Bitcoin market supports the sequential information arrival hypothesis in that day trading volume, which is a proxy for user differences of opinion, has a statistically significant effect on returns volatility. Third, for the proxies of user interest, namely, the growth rate of page views on Google Trends and Wikipedia, only the growth rate of Google Trends shows statistically significant effects on Bitcoin returns volatility. This study can provide useful information to the financial market and policy makers on the behavior of the Bitcoin market, which may help to lower future entry barriers and opportunity costs of the Bitcoin market. © 2018"

However, although federated learning uses encrypted security aggregation, its decentralised nature makes it vulnerable to malicious attackers. A deliberate attacker can subtly control one or more participants and upload malicious model parameter updates, but the aggregation server cannot detect it due to encrypted privacy protection. Based on these problems, we find a practical and novel security risk in the design of federal learning. We propose an attack for conspired malicious participants to adjust the training data strategically so that the weight of a certain dimension in the aggregation model will rise or fall with a pattern. The trend of weights or parameters in the aggregation model forms meaningful signals, which is the risk of information leakage. The leakage is exposed to other participants in this federation but only available for participants who reach an agreement with the malicious participant, i.e., the receiver must be able to understand patterns of changes in weights.

At any time, MHS could be enabled as Wi-Fi Hotspot in mobility devices (smart phone, tablet) with cellular backhaul network (3G/4G/5G) and provides Internet access to client devices such as laptop, TV etc. Unlike Wi-Fi Access Point, which is typically a powered device, MHS is enabled as battery-operated device. In addition, MHS consumes higher power and reported as one of the primary Voice of Customer (VoC) issue. Due to high power consumption, many customers are skeptical about MHS feature and its continuous usage. Apart from few literatures, there is no specific IEEE 802.11 standard for MHS and its power management. In this paper, we have proposed a Machine Learning (ML) based Intelligent MHS Power Save (I-MHSPS) algorithm using Wi-Fi parameters such as RSSI, SNR, TX power and channel condition. In addition, we have used other contextual parameters such as client behavior, battery level, application usage and internet backhaul to improve the accuracy of our algorithm. In I-MHSPS, we have proposed Intelligent Transmit Power Control (I-TPC): MHS TX power regulation based on client vicinity, Intelligent Ultra Power Save (I-UPS): Applying different system power level for MHS operation and Intelligent Low Power Encryption (I-LPE): Enabling low power encryption for short range MHS. In our first experiment with I-TPC idea has reduced power consumption by 10-16% approximately when compared to existing methodologies. In second experiment for I-UPS, we have applied different system power levels for MHS operation and achieved power saving around 22% without any performance degradation. Further, in third experiment, using I-LPE method, we have observed the power required for encryption of data packets reduced by 20%. © 2020 IEEE."
intelligent prediction of cryptogenic stroke using patent foramen ovale from tee imaging data and machine learning methods,"bai j., yang j., song w., liu y., xu h., liu y.",international journal of computational intelligence systems,2022,10.1007/s44196-022-00067-8,cryptogenic stroke; multi-doppler sensor; patent foramen ovale; prediction diagnosis; random forest,3,Journal,Q2,"In spite of the popularity of random forests (RF) as an efficient machine learning algorithm, methods for constructing the potential association for between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke (CS) using this technique are still barely. For the vital regional study areas (atrial septum), RF was used to predict CS in patients with PFO using partial clinical data of patients and remotely sensed imaging examination data obtained from Tee imaging. We validated our method on a dataset of 151 consecutive patients with detected PFO at a large grade A hospital in China from November 2018 to December 2020, we obtained an area under the relative operating characteristic curve of 0.816, with 65% specificity at 73% sensitivity. The RF models accurately represented the relationship between the CS and remotely sensed predictor variables. Therein, maximum mobility, large right-to-left shunt during Valsalva maneuver, size of PFO in diastole and systole, and diastolic length of the tunnel present higher predictive value in CS. Our findings suggest that multi-Doppler sensor data by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-detected morphologic and functional characteristics of PFO may play important roles in the occurrence of CS. These results indicate that the established random forest model has the potential to predict CS in patients with PFO and great promise for application to clinical practice. © 2022, The Author(s)."

The main contribution is to use these data analytics techniques with great caution in the parameterization, instead of classical parametric modelings (AR), to disentangle the non-stationary behavior of the data. As soon as Bitcoin is also used for diversification in portfolios, we need to investigate its interactions with stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, and commodities.

PIs are susceptible to monetary losses in the open market due to the aforementioned issues. The fraudsters could be both internal (operator of the scheme) and external (financial institutions (FI), such as banks, money-lenders, and insurance companies). The centrality of trust among stakeholders like PI, CF, and FI is a prime concern. Motivated from these facts, this paper proposes a decentralized framework, KaRuNa, A Blockchain-based Sentiment analysis framework for Fraud Cryptocurrency schemes. KaRuNa operates on public blockchain three phases of trust modeling among stakeholders. In the first phase, transactions are performed on the blockchain that offers trust, auditability, and transparency among stakeholders.

The lake cryptodepression, filled with 220 million m3 of fresh drinking water, represents a specific karst phenomenon. To better understand the impact of water level change drivers, the occurrence of meteorological and hydrological droughts was analysed. Basic machine learning methods (ML) such as the multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to simulate water levels. Modelling was carried out considering annual inputs of precipitation, air temperature, and abstraction rate as well as their influential lags which were determined by auto-correlation and cross-correlation techniques. Hydrological droughts have been recorded since 1986, and after 2006 a series of mostly mild hot to moderate hot years was recorded. All three ML models have been trained to recognize extreme conditions in the form of less precipitation, high abstraction rate, and, consequently, low water levels in the testing (predicting) period. The best statistical indicators were achieved with the MNLR model. The methodologies applied in the study were found to be useful tools for the analysis of changes in water levels. Extended monitoring of water balance elements should precede any future increase in the abstraction rate. © 2022 by the authors."

Models trained via a Neural Network (NN) can offer accurate and efficient inference services for mobile users. Unfortunately, the current deployment of such service encounters privacy concerns. Directly offloading the model to the mobile device violates model privacy of the model owner, while feeding user input to the service compromises user privacy. To address this issue, we propose Leia, a lightweight cryptographic NN inference system at the edge. Leia is designed from two mobile-friendly perspectives. First, it leverages the paradigm of edge computing wherein the inference procedure keeps the model closer to the mobile user to foster low latency service. Specifically, Leia's architecture consists of two non-colluding edge services to obliviously perform NN inference on the encoded user data and model. Second, Leia's realization makes the judicious use of potentially constrained computational and communication resources in edge devices. We adapt the Binarized Neural Network (BNN), a trending flavor of NN with low inference overhead, and purely choose the lightweight secret sharing techniques to realize secure blocks of BNN. We implement Leia and deploy it on Raspberry Pi. Empirical evaluations on benchmark and medical datasets via various models demonstrate the practicality of Leia."

In the rest of this paper we will use the terms âBitcoin priceâ and âBitcoin's exchange rateâ interchangeably to represent the amount of fiat currency (USD) needed to buy one Bitcoin at a given time. We consider, besides classical properties, a novel notion of Trustful Transaction Graph introduced to describe partial Users Graphs derived by chains of 0-confirmation transactions. We present a temporal analysis of the evolution of a set of features with a single day granularity. Afterwards, we applied autoregressive distributed-lag linear regression to assess whether and with which strength and duration a change in the considered features is likely to influence the exchange rate up to a prespecified number of days (fifteen) in the future. The results show that some of the considered features significantly influence the exchange rate up to several days, and that such relationships are likely not to be spurious, since we found that those features contribute significantly to decrease the error in predicting the exchange rate."

It has many applications in various areas such as finance, education, genomics, and medical field that have sensitive private data. While several studies have been reported on the prediction phase, few studies have been conducted on the training phase. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for logistic regression on homomorphic encrypted data, and evaluate our algorithm on real financial data consisting of 422,108 samples over 200 features. Our experiment shows that an encrypted model with a sufficient Kolmogorov Smirnow statistic value can be obtained in ~17 hours in a single machine. We also evaluate our algorithm on the public MNIST dataset, and it takes ~2 hours to learn an encrypted model with 96.4% accuracy.

For this goal, we applied several the most powerful methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forests (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machine (SGBM). As dataset were selected the daily close prices of two stock index: SP 500 and NASDAQ, two the most capitalized cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and exchange rate of EUR-USD. As features we used only the past price information. To check the efficiency of these models we made out-of-sample forecast for selected time series by using one step ahead technique. The accuracy rates of the forecasted prices by using ML models were calculated. The results verify the applicability of the ML approach for the forecasting of financial time series. The best out of sample accuracy of short-term prediction daily close prices for selected time series obtained by SGBM and MLP in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was within 0.46-3.71 %.

Therefore, protecting these WSN networks from Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) is one of the WSN networks security tasks. Traditional packet deep scan systems that rely on open field inspection in transport layer security packets and the open field encryption trend are making machine learning-based systems the only viable choice for these types of attacks. This paper contributes to the evaluation of the use machine learning algorithms in WSN nodes traffic and their effect on WSN network life time. We examined the performance metrics of different machine learning classification categories such as K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gboost, Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on a WSN-dataset in different sizes. The test results proved that the statistical and logical classification categories performed the best on numeric statistical datasets, and the Gboost algorithm showed the best performance compared to different algorithms on average of all performance metrics. The performance metrics used in these validations were accuracy, F1-score, False Positive Ratio (FPR), False Negative Ratio (FNR), and the training execution time. Moreover, the test results showed the Gboost algorithm got 99.6%, 98.8%, 0.4% 0.13% in accuracy, F1-score, FPR, and FNR, respectively. At training execution time, it obtained 1.41 s for the average of all training time execution datasets. In addition, this paper demonstrated that for the numeric statistical data type, the best results are in the size of the dataset ranging from 3000 to 6000 records and the percentage between categories is not less than 50% for each category with the other categories. Furthermore, this paper investigated the effect of Gboost on the WSN lifetime, which resulted in a 32% reduction compared to other Gboost-free scenarios. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Recent trends in the evolution of Internet traffic present a challenge for traditional traffic analysis methods to achieve accurate classification of Internet traffic including Voice over IP (VoIP), text messaging, video, and audio services among others. A key aspect of this trend is the rising levels of encrypted multiple service channels where the payload is opaque to middleboxes in the network. In such scenarios, traditional approaches such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) or examination of Port numbers are unable to achieve the classification accuracy required. This work investigates Machine Learning-based network traffic classifiers as a means of accurately classifying encrypted multiple service channels. The study carries out a thorough study which (i) proposes and evaluates two machine learning-based frameworks for multiple service channels analysis; (ii) undertakes feature engineering to identify the minimum number of features required to obtain high accuracy while reducing the effects of over-fitting; (iii) explores the portability and robustness of the frameworks trained models under different network conditions: location, time, and volume; and (iv) collects and analyzes a large-scale dataset including nine classes of services, for benchmarking purposes. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Content related information that can be used in such strategies include information about the video frame type (Intra-Predicted, Inter-Predicted or Backward-Predicted). Frame type identification and prediction in the MAC layer scheduler (as well as in other network locations) is hence a critical part of content-aware resource management and traffic engineering in video streaming. It is important to note that, when encryption is adopted at the upper layers, packet inspection is not possible. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive clustering and prediction algorithm. The algorithm uses unsupervised clustering combined with an adaptive classification approach to automatically group packets into frame clusters. Unlike conventional video traffic classifiers, our approach requires neither a-priori knowledge of video frames pattern nor a training set of frames. Instead, this approach automatically classifies packets into different frame types by employing simple statistical features. The proposed method continuously learns from the upcoming traffic thus the proper frame class labels can be easily discovered. Furthermore, the proposed method uses an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm to predict the upcoming traffic frame type. A large number of experiments has been carried out using data from several video samples. Results show the robustness and the effectiveness of our classification method, which is capable of achieving a detection rate of up to 97.3% for I frames and overall 2 identification accuracy of 91.3% (for all I, P and B frames). © 2019 IEEE."

The network provides interactive voice and data telecommunication services for air traffic control in the region and, as such, requires high availability and performance. Outages do not only result in a degradation of service, but they also constitute safety risks.While network optimization in networks is typically the result of parameter measurements, more sophisticated and advanced solutions rely on real-time deep packet inspections to derive optimization parameters.However, Air Traffic Control (ATC) networks in the future will be protected by end-to-end encryption algorithms such as TLS or DTLS. That means that deep packet inspection will not be possible anymore, and the data plane can only see up to the transport layer information (port numbers), but not deeper.Different methods for network optimizations are needed. This paper describes an algorithm that uses Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to predict the probability of transmission errors in the satellite link communication. This prediction can then be used to perform such network optimizations. The ML concept described predicts the symbol energy-to-noise power density [energy per bit] of a satellite link.The complete satellite link performance data is combined with associated, regional weather data to create training samples for a regression type machine learning prediction. The training samples contain history and future windows so that the trained neural network is able to perform sequence to sequence predictions to output the predicted future symbol energy-to-noise power density.During the training a Tree Parzen hyperparameter optimizer is used to select the best fitting neural network topology and training parameters like neuron number or optimizer learning rate. Machine learning pipelines allow the execution of necessary data manipulation steps like sample filtering of invalid samples, interpolating missing sample values or necessary normalization.The concept was validated as part of the SINAPSE research project in the MEVA III network. The completed hyperparameter training of 30 models demonstrates that the trend of the energy-to-noise power density can be predicted correctly in many cases.

Although PUFs are supposed to be unclonable or unbreakable, researchers have found that they are vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, we analyze the vulnerability of different FPGA-based Ring Oscillator PUFs (ROPUFs) to machine learning attacks. The challenge-response pairs (CRPs) data obtained from different ROPUFs is trained using different machine learning algorithms. From the study, it is found that the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models can be used to train the ROPUFs with a training accuracy of 99.9% and a prediction accuracy of 62% when 5,000 CRPs are used for a challenge-response ROPUF. In this article, we assume a realistic situation where a small set of the CRP dataset (approximately 15% maximum) is unscrupulously obtained by the hacker. A prediction accuracy of 62% makes the PUF vulnerable to machine learning attacks. Therefore, a secondary goal of this article is the design of a ROPUF capable of thwarting machine learning modeling attacks. The modified XOR-inverter ROPUF drastically reduces the prediction accuracy from 62% to 13.1%, thus making it increasingly difficult for hackers to attack the ROPUF. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery."

One of the major types of malware, ransomware, encrypts a user’s sensitive information and only returns the original files to the user after a ransom is paid. As malware developers shift the delivery of their product from HTTP to HTTPS to protect themselves from payload inspection, we can no longer rely on deep packet inspection to extract features for malware identification. Toward this goal, we propose a solution leveraging a recent trend in networking hardware, that is programmable forwarding engines (PFEs). PFEs allow collection of per-packet, network monitoring data at high rates. We use this data to monitor the network traffic between an infected computer and the command and control (C&C) server. We extract high-level flow features from this traffic and use this data for ransomware classification. We write a stream processor and use a random forest, binary classifier to utilizes these rich flow records in fingerprinting malicious, network activity without the requirement of deep packet inspection. Our classification model achieves a detection rate in excess of 0.86, while maintaining a false negative rate under 0.11. Our results suggest that a flow-based fingerprinting method is feasible and accurate enough to catch ransomware before encryption. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Detection based on features of network traffic and machine learning algorithms is a common approach to identify malicious events. The performance of approaches is associated with the used features and algorithms. In this paper, we propose MalFinder, an ensemble learning-based framework for malicious traffic detection. Considering the trend of network traffic encryption and the complexity of decrypting traffic, we utilize statistical features and sequence features to describe network traffic. We extend the dimensions of these two types of features to enhance their capability for representing traffic data. Feature importance analysis and contrast experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our new features. Among our selected classifiers suitable for malicious traffic detection, boosting-based classifiers XGBoost and LightGBM can reduce bias, and bagging-based classifier Random Forest can reduce variance. Stacking, which is the integration method of the classification results used in our framework, can improve the generalization ability of the method. MalFinder can achieve 96.58% F-measure and 95.44% accuracy in the malicious traffic detection task on a real-world dataset, whose results are better than those of comparison methods. In terms of unseen malicious traffic discovery, MalFinder still provides good performance with 93.46% F-measure and 91.04% accuracy, which even surpasses the results in the task of known malicious traffic detection of other comparative methods.

This primitive is desirable for key generation and authentication in constrained devices, due to its low power and low area overhead. However, in recent years many research papers are focused on the vulnerability of PUFs to modeling attacks. This attack is possible because the PUFs challenge and response exchanges are usually transmitted over communication channel without encryption. Thus, an attacker can collect challenge-response pairs and use it as input into a learning algorithm, to create a model that can predict responses given new challenges. In this paper we introduce a serial and a parallel novel 64-bits memory-based controlled PUF (Mc-PUF) architecture for device authentication that has high uniqueness and randomness, reliable, and resilient against modeling attacks. These architectures generate a response by utilizing bits extracted from the fingerprint of a synchronous random-access memory (SRAM) PUF with a control logic. The synthesis of the serial architecture yielded an area of 1.136K GE, while the parallel architecture was 3.013K GE. The best prediction accuracy obtained from the modeling attack was ~50%, which prevents an attacker from accurately predicting responses to future challenges. We also showcase the scalability of the design through XOR-ing several Mc-PUFs, further improving upon its security and performance. The remainder of the paper presents the proposed architectures, along with their hardware implementations, area and power consumption, and security resilience against modeling attacks. The 3-XOR Mc-PUF had the greatest overhead, but it produced the best randomness, uniqueness, and resilience against modeling attacks. © 2021 IEEE."

Security parameters such as correlation coefficient (<0.01), entropy (>7.70), number of pixel change rate (>99%), unified average change intensity (>33), contrast (>10), homogeneity (<0.3) and energy (<0.01) prove the efficacy of the proposed encryption scheme. © 2020 by the authors.

mobius: model-oblivious binarized neural networks,"kitai h., cruz j.p., yanai n., nishida n., oba t., unagami y., teruya t., attrapadung n., matsuda t., hanaoka g.",ieee access,2019,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939410,model obliviousness; neural network predictions; privacy-preserving machine learning; secure computation,2,Journal,Q1,"A privacy-preserving framework in which a computational resource provider receives encrypted data from a client and returns prediction results without decrypting the data, i.e., oblivious neural network or encrypted prediction, has been studied in machine learning. In this work, we introduce and explore a new problem called the model-oblivious problem, where a trainer can delegate a protected model to a resource provider without revealing the original model itself to the resource provider. The resource provider can then offer prediction on a client's input data, which is additionally kept private from the resource provider. To solve this problem, we present MOBIUS (Model-Oblivious BInary neUral networkS), a new system that combines Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) and secure computation based on secret sharing as tools for scalable and fast privacy-preserving machine learning. BNNs improve computational performance by binarizing values in training to-1 and +1, while secure computation based on secret sharing provides fast and various computations under encrypted forms via modulo operations with a short bit length. However, combining these tools is not trivial because their operations have different algebraic structures. MOBIUS uses improved procedures of BNNs and secure computation that have compatible algebraic structures without downgrading prediction accuracy. We present an implementation of MOBIUS in C++ using the ABY library (NDSS 2015). Then, we conduct experiments using several datasets, including the MNIST, Cancer, and Diabetes datasets, and the results show that MOBIUS outperforms SecureML (IEEE S&P 2017), which is the only other work that can potentially tackle the model-oblivious problem, in terms of both accuracy and computational time. Compared with TAPAS (ICML 2018) as a state-of-The-Art BNN-based system, MOBIUS is three orders of magnitude faster without downgrading the accuracy despite solving the model-oblivious problem. © 2013 IEEE."
moles: malicious off-chip leakage enabled by side-channels,l. lin; w. burleson; c. paar,2009 ieee/acm international conference on computer-aided design - digest of technical papers,2009,,,1,Conference,CORE - A,"Economic incentives have driven the semiconductor industry to separate design from fabrication in recent years. This trend leads to potential vulnerabilities from untrusted circuit foundries to covertly implant malicious hardware trojans into a genuine design. Hardware trojans provide back doors for on-chip manipulation, or leak secret information off-chip once the compromised IC is deployed in the field. This paper explores the design space of hardware Trojans and proposes a novel technique, Â¿Malicious Off-chip Leakage Enabled by Side-channelsÂ¿ (MOLES), which employs power side-channels to convey secret information off-chip. An experimental MOLES circuit is designed with fewer than 50 gates and is embedded into an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptographic circuit in a predictive 45 nm CMOS technology model. Engineered by a spread-spectrum technique, the MOLES technique is capable of leaking multi-bit information below the noise power level of the host IC to evade evaluators' detections. In addition, a generalized methodology for a class of MOLES circuits and design verification by statistical correlation analysis are presented. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the potential threats of MOLES on embedded system security. Nevertheless, MOLES could be constructively used for hardware authentication, fingerprinting and IP protection."

Three highest cryptocurrencies uphold are Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP. This condition made these three cryptocurrencies become the important investment products. However, cryptocurrency is the product with high volatility. Because of that, this study aims to monitor financial stability from cryptocurrencies prediction using artificial intelligent algorithm. This research copes the problem by predicting bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP using three different intelligent algorithms, which are K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). By this prediction had been figured out about up and down value of cryptocurrencies using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate stabilization of finance. Accuration system with LSTM shown that the price of cryptocurrency will fit with the data actual using LSTM, in which the accuracy around 80%.

multi class svm algorithm with active learning for network traffic classification,dong s.,expert systems with applications,2021,10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114885,cmsvm; imbalance problem; machine learning; netflow flow; svm; traffic classification,34,Journal,Q1,"With the current massive amount of traffic that is going through the internet, internet service providers (ISPs) and networking service providers (NSPs) are looking for various ways to accurately predict the application type of flow that is going through the internet. Such prediction is critical for security and network monitoring applications as they require application type to be known in prior. Traditional ways using port-based or payload-based analysis are not sufficient anymore as many applications start using dynamic unknown port numbers, masquerading, and encryption techniques to avoid being detected. Recently, machine learning has gained significant attention in many prediction applications including traffic classification from flow features or characteristics. However, such algorithms suffer from an imbalanced data problem where some applications have fewer flow data and hence difficult to predict. In this paper, we employ network flow-level characteristics to identify the application type of traffic. Furthermore, we propose the use of an improved support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, named cost-sensitive SVM (CMSVM), to solve the imbalance problem in network traffic identification. CMSVM adopts a multi-class SVM algorithm with active learning which dynamically assigns a weight for applications. We examine the classification accuracy and performance of the CMSVM algorithm using two different datasets, namely MOORE_SET and NOC_SET datasets. Our results show that the CMSVM algorithm can reduce computation cost, improve classification accuracy and solve the imbalance problem when compared to other machine learning techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Forecasting the Bitcoin price as accurate as possible is essential, but due to its high volatility this task is challenging. Many researchers try, through the years, to develop efficient models for predicting the Bitcoin price using several different data-driven approaches. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel decomposition-ensemble learning model that combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) with machine learning algorithms to forecast the Bitcoin price multi-step ahead. The algorithms are k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel, Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with single-layer perceptron, Generalized Linear Model, and Cubist. Correlation matrix (CORR), principal component analysis (PCA), and Box-Cox transformation (BOXCOX) were used as data preprocessing techniques. Estimating the performance of the proposed models (namely VMD-STACK-CORR, VMD-STACK-PCA, and VMD-STACK-BOXCOX) using relative root mean square error, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and absolute percentage error measures, defined that for one-day-ahead forecast VMD-STAK-BOXCOX model presented the better performance, and for two and three-days-ahead forecast VMD-STACK-CORR model was chosen, compared to VMD, STACK, and machine learning algorithms models' performance. Diebold-Mariano statistical test was conducted to evaluate a reduction in forecasting errors. Therefore, the proposed models (VMD-STACK-CORR, VMD-STACK-PCA, and VMD-STACK-BOXCOX) indeed forecast accurately Bitcoin price and outperformed the compared models (VMD, STACK, and machine learning models). © 2020 IEEE."

Indeed, there has been a plethora of DL-based trading methods proposed in recent years. Despite the success of these methods, they typically rely on a very restricted set of information, usually employing only price-related information. As a result, they ignore sentiment-related information, which can have a profound impact and be a strong predictor of various assets, such as cryptocurencies. The contribution of this paper is multifold. First, we examine whether the use of sentiment information, as extracted by various online sources, including news articles, is beneficial when training DL agents for trading. Then, given the difficulty of training reliable sentiment extractors for financial applications, we evaluate the impact of using different DL models as sentiment extractors, as well as employ an unsupervised training pipeline for further improving their performance. Finally, we propose an effective multisource sentiment fusion approach that can improve the performance over the rest of the evaluated approaches. The conducted experiments have been performed using several different configurations and models, ranging from multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to provide a reliable evaluation of sentiment-aware DL-based trading strategies providing evidence that sentiment information might be a stronger predictor compared to the information provided by the actual price time series for Bitcoin. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

However, the spread of ML technologies allows an attacker to use them into the attack for the sake of sniffing secret information. Since the randomness has been used for an inseparable part of the cryptographic applications to ensure the security, the resistance of a random sequence against analysis based on the ML technologies have to be required. The authors anticipate having the mutual relationship between the classical properties of the randomness, linear complexity (LC) in particular, and the structure of a neural network (NN), which is a class of ML. In this research, the authors find that the strength of each connection between nodes in the NN is relevant to the linear recurrence relation of the target sequence by observing parameters after complete learning. In other words, the difficulty of predicting the next bits from a given sequence would be discussed based on the LC of a sequence in most cases.

In this paper, we survey the most prominent research works that cover neural networks based cryptography from two main periods. The first period covers the oldest models that have been proposed shortly after 2000 and the second period covers the more recent models that have been proposed since 2016. We first discuss the implementation of the systems from the earlier era and the attacks mounted on them. After that, we focus on post 2016 era where more advanced techniques are utilized that rely on GANs in which neural networks compete with each other in order to achieve a goal e.g. learning to encrypt a communication.

The blockchain is a tamper-evident, unforgeable distributed ledger that protects security and privacy through the famous algorithm zk-SNARK, which is also widely used in virtual digital currencies such as Zcash. In addition, by using zk-SNARK technology in the Loopring DEX 3.0 in Ethereum, not only decentralization but also transaction performance can be guaranteed. However, there are three main problems of zk-SNARK, one is the need to guarantee calculation accuracy, two is the long time to generate evidence, especially when using Lagrangian interpolation to QAP the transaction data requires more computation; the last is the poor scalability, especially when nodes need to recalculate all data when adding new transactions. In this paper, we propose a modified zk-SNARK based on Newtonian interpolation, improve the QAP part of zk-SNARK by Newtonian interpolation, and verify the correctness of the scheme through instantiation. Finally, we analyze the computational efficiency of the two interpolation methods, and the results show that Newton interpolation solves the above two problems in the original zk-SNARK, and significantly reduces the time complexity of the algorithm, which can further promote the application of blockchain in data management of AIoT. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

This study tries to fill this gap by comparing the forecasting performances of 110 GARCH-type models for Bitcoin volatility. Furthermore, it proposes a new combining method based on support vector machines (SVM). This method effectively selects the set of superior models to perform meta-learning.

In order to achieve this, we present an efficient algorithm for multimodal statistical causality analysis based on Multiple-Output Gaussian Processes. Signals from different information sources (modalities) are jointly modelled as a Multiple-Output Gaussian Process, and then using a novel approach to statistical causality based on Gaussian Processes (GPs), we study linear and non-linear causal effects between the different modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a machine learning application by studying the relationship between cryptocurrency spot price dynamics and sentiment time-series data specific to the crypto sector, which we conjecture influences retail investor behaviour. The investor sentiment is extracted from cryptomarket news data via methods developed in the area of statistical machine learning known as Natural Language Processing (NLP). To capture sentiment, we present a novel framework for text to time-series embedding, which we then use to construct a sentiment index from publicly available news articles. We conduct a statistical analysis of our sentiment statistical index model and compare it to alternative state-of-the-art sentiment models popular in the NLP literature. In regard to the multimodal causality, the investor sentiment is our primary modality of exploration, in addition to price and a blockchain technology-related indicator (hash rate). Analysis shows that our approach is effective in modelling causal structures of variable degree of complexity between heterogeneous data sources and illustrates the impact that certain modelling choices for the different modalities can have on detecting causality.

optimizing privacy-preserving outsourced convolutional neural network predictions,"li m., chow s.s.m., hu s., yan y., shen c., wang q.",ieee transactions on dependable and secure computing,2022,10.1109/TDSC.2020.3029899,convolutional neural network; homomorphic encryption; machine learning; secure outsourcing,6,Journal,Q1,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a popular architecture in machine learning for its predictive power, notably in computer vision and medical image analysis. Its great predictive power requires extensive computation, which encourages model owners to host the prediction service in a cloud platform. This article proposes a CNN prediction scheme that preserves privacy in the outsourced setting, i.e., the model-hosting server cannot learn the query, (intermediate) results, and the model. Similar to SecureML (S&P'17), a representative work that provides model privacy, we employ two non-colluding servers with secret sharing and triplet generation to minimize the usage of heavyweight cryptography. We made the following optimizations for both overall latency and accuracy. 1) We adopt asynchronous computation and SIMD for offline triplet generation and parallelizable online computation. 2) As MiniONN (CCS'17) and its improvement by the generic EzPC compiler (EuroS&P'19), we use a garbled circuit for the non-polynomial ReLU activation to keep the same accuracy as the underlying network (instead of approximating it in SecureML prediction). 3) For the pooling in CNN, we employ (linear) average-pooling, which achieves almost the same accuracy as the (non-linear, and hence less efficient) max-pooling exhibited by MiniONN and EzPC. Considering both offline and online costs, our experiments on the MNIST dataset show a latency reduction of 122×, 14.63×, and 36.69× compared to SecureML, MiniONN, and EzPC; and a reduction of communication costs by 1.09×, 36.69×, and 31.32×, respectively. On the CIFAR dataset, our scheme achieves a lower latency by 7.14× and 3.48× and lower communication costs by 13.88× and 77.46× when compared with MiniONN and EzPC, respectively. © 2004-2012 IEEE."

In recent years, the popularity of cloud computing has caused many data owners to seek outsourced storage computing, which has become a new trend in the development of classification. Although it can be used in several research areas, such as medical and financial, this paradigm introduces new security and privacy problems. In response to the ciphertext classification requirements in different scenarios in outsourcing environments, this paper proposed an outsourced privacy-preserving decision tree classification model based on homomorphic encryption, which can hide sensitive inputs (model and query) and outputs (analytic result) from a counterparty. A secure exclusive OR (XOR) protocol is created; it intelligently computes the XOR of two bit-encrypted data to obtain another bit-encrypted result. The experimental results show that the proposed protocols are particularly efficient for outsourced decision trees, which are encrypted and stored in the cloud. These decision trees are typical of classification models trained from real datasets, ranging from heart disease to cancer classification. © 2020"

The majority of the forecasting solutions reported have some level of error and cannot predict the price accurately due to randomness. The proposed model consists of using parent coins as a parameter for price prediction to overcome market volatility. Moving average is used as a data preprocessing technique for the effective prediction of Litecoin and Dogecoin prices.

By applying the leveled homomorphic encryption scheme, CryptoNets enables the cloud server to securely run the computation process without participations of other parties. Since the encryption scheme only supports polynomial operations, the authors simply use square activation as a substitution of the conventional activations, obtaining a relatively low prediction accuracy on the MNIST dataset (98.95%). Later work try to improve the accuracy by using polynomial approximations of the ReLU activation with large neural networks, which introduce heavy computation cost, making the prediction process impractical. In this paper, to achieve better prediction performance, we propose new parametric polynomial (PPoly) activations, which can adaptively learn the parameters during the training phase. Using our PPoly activations, we achieve higher accuracy (99.33%, 99.64%, and 99.70%) with shallow and narrow networks, guaranteeing the efficiency of prediction process. We conduct extensive experiments to show the expressiveness of our PPoly activations and discuss the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency for the prediction on encrypted data. © 2013 IEEE."

Different unsupervised machine learning techniques are used to build the predictive models. These techniques include K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayesian Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. A dataset of 10 daily supply-side metrics for three prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin) at four different time horizons (ranging from one day to 30 days) are used to build and test the machine learning models. The outputs of these models indicate the predicted direction of the price movement over the time horizon (i.e., whether the price would go up or down), not the magnitude of the movement. Experimental results show that predictions were very unreliable for the shorter time spans but very reliable for the longest time spans.

However, the challenge in predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate is its high volatility. Therefore, the prediction of its behavior is of great importance for financial markets. In this way, recent studies have been carried out on what internal and/or external Bitcoin information is relevant to its prediction. The increased use of machine learning techniques to predict time series and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments motivated the present study to seek more accurate predictions for the Bitcoin exchange rate. In this way, in a first stage of the proposed methodology, different feature selection techniques were evaluated in order to obtain the most relevant attributes for the predictions. In the sequence, it was analyzed the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble algorithms (based on Recurrent Neural Networks and the k-Means clustering method) for price direction predictions. Likewise, the ANN and SVM were employed for regression of the maximum, minimum and closing prices of the Bitcoin. Moreover, the regression results were also used as inputs to try to improve the price direction predictions. The results showed that the selected attributes and the best machine learning model achieved an improvement of more than 10%, in accuracy, for the price direction predictions, with respect to the state-of-the-art papers, using the same period of information. In relation to the maximum, minimum and closing Bitcoin prices regressions, it was possible to obtain Mean Absolute Percentage Errors between 1% and 2%. Based on these results, it was possible to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology when compared to other studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

In this paper, we present a novel machine-learning model, solving a binary classification problem, that can predict transaction fee volatility in the Bitcoin network so that users can optimize their fees expenses and the approval time for their transactions. The model's output will give a confidence score whether a new incoming transaction will be included in the next mined block. The model is trained on data from a longitudinal study of the Bitcoin blockchain, containing more than 10 million transactions. New features that we generate include information on how many bytes were already occupied by other transactions in the mempool, assuming they are ordered by fee density in each mining pool. The collected dataset allows to generate a model for transaction inclusion pattern prediction in the Bitcoin network, hence telling whether a transaction is well formed or not, according to the previous transactions analyzed.

There has been a huge increase in the number of cryptocurrencies in the past few years. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have become an interesting subject of study in fields such as finance. In 2021, over 4,000 cryptocurrencies are already listed. There are many past studies that focus on predicting the price of cryptocurrencies using machine learning, but the majority of them only focused on Bitcoin. Moreover, the majority of the models implemented for price prediction only used the historical market prices, and do not utilize social signals related to the cryptocurrency. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for predicting the prices of dogecoin cryptocurrency. The proposed model is based on historical market price data as well as social trends of Dogecoin cryptocurrency. METHODS: The market data of Dogecoin is collected from Kaggle on the granularity of a day and for the same duration the verified tweets have also been collected with hashtags “Dogecoin” and “Doge”. Experimental results show that the proposed model yields a promising prediction of future price of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that has recently become the talk of the town of the crypto market. RESULTS: Minimum achieved RMSE in predicted price of Dogecoin was 0.02 where the feature vector consisted of OCVP (Open, Close, Volume, Polarity) values from combined dataset. RESULTS: Experimental results show that the proposed approach performs efficiently. © 2021. Basant Agarwal et al., licensed to EAI.

This paper presents PRICURE, a system that combines complementary strengths of secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and differential privacy (DP) to enable privacy-preserving collaborative prediction among multiple model owners. SMPC enables secret-sharing of private models and client inputs with non-colluding secure servers to compute predictions without leaking model parameters and inputs. DP masks true prediction results via noisy aggregation so as to deter a semi-honest client who may mount membership inference attacks. We evaluate PRICURE on neural networks across four datasets including benchmark medical image classification datasets. Our results suggest PRICURE guarantees privacy for tens of model owners and clients with acceptable accuracy loss.

privacy-preserving convolutional neural network prediction with low latency and lightweight users,"li f., chen y., duan p., zhang b., hong z., hu y., wang b.",international journal of intelligent systems,2022,10.1002/int.22640,cnn; homomorphic encryption; prediction; privacy preservation; secret sharing,1,Journal,Q1,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have excellent and extensive applications in image recognition. With the continuous exploitation of data value and the proliferation of machine learning-as-a-service, convolutional neural network prediction schemes on privacy preservation have been introduced one after another, which makes much more attention focused on the privacy leakage and services offered to be efficient and light. Therefore, how to improve the convolutional neural prediction scheme on the premise of privacy preservation turns out to be an imperative research issue. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving convolutional neural network prediction scheme (PCP-LL) that supports low latency and lightweight users. The scheme starts from the perspective of lossless accuracy from underlying networks. First, we construct a secure activation function computing protocol (SActF) utilizing a commodity-based secure comparison protocol, which reduces the complexity and latency during the activation function computing under ciphertexts compared with common schemes. Second, to further support lightweight users, we introduce a secure output layer protocol (SOut) that enables users to obtain the prediction results without extra decryption after simple operations. Then, the scheme adopts the distributed two trapdoors public-key cryptosystem (DT-PKC) to achieve both data and model security, which well avoids security issues especially such as wiretapping by semi-honest participants commonly in secret sharing schemes. Finally, through relevant evaluations, the scheme not only achieves privacy preservation and low latency, but also supports lightweight users. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC"

In addition, the amount of law data of an institution is not large enough to well train a deep model. To solve these challenges, some privacy-preserving deep learning are proposed to capture knowledge of privacy data.

privacy-preserving locally weighted linear regression over encrypted millions of data,"dong x., chen j., zhang k., qian h.",ieee access,2020,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2962700,locally weighted linear regression; paillier homomorphic encryption; privacy-preserving; stochastic gradient descent,3,Journal,Q1,"The emerging development of cloud computing makes a trend that the cloud becomes a outsourced agglomeration for storing big data that generally contains numerous information. To mine the rich value involved in big data, the machine learning methodology is widespread employed due to its ability to adapt to data changes. However, the data mining process may involve the privacy issues of the users, hence they are reluctant to share their information. This is the reason why the outsourced data need to be dealt with securely, where data encryption is considered to be the most straightforward method to keep the privacy of data, but machine learning on the data in ciphertext domain is more complicated than the plaintext, since the relationship structure between data is no longer maintained, in such a way that we focus on the machine learning over encrypted big data. In this work, we study locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), a widely used classic machine learning algorithm in real-world, such as predict and find the best-fit curve through numerous data points. To tackle the privacy concerns in utilizing the LWLR algorithm, we present a system for privacy-preserving locally weighted linear regression, where the system not only protects the privacy of users but also encrypts the best-fit curve. Therefore, we use Paillier homomorphic encryption as the building modular to encrypt data and then apply the stochastic gradient descent in encrypted domain. After given a security analysis, we study how to let Paillier encryption deal with real numbers and implement the system in Python language with a couple of experiments on real-world data sets to evaluate the effectiveness, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art and occurs negligible errors compared with performing locally weighted linear regression in the clear. © 2013 IEEE."

As supporting homomorphic operations over encrypted data without decryption, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) contributes to machine learning classification without leaking user privacy, especially in the outsouring scenario. In this paper, we propose an improved FHE scheme based on HElib, which is a FHE library implemented based on Brakerski's FHE scheme. Our improvement focuses on two aspects. On the one hand, we first use the relinearization technique to reduce the ciphertext size, and then the modulus switching technique is used to reduce the modulus and decryption noise. On the other hand, we need no relinearization and modulus switching if there is additive homomorphic or no homomorphic operation in the multiplicative ciphertext's next homomorphic operation. Homomorphic comparison protocol, private hyperplane decision-based classification and private Naïve Bayes classification are implemented by additive homomorphic and multiplicative homomorphic first. In our homomorphic comparison protocol, the number of interactions is reduced from 3 to 1. We choose the proposed FHE scheme to implement private decision tree classification. Simulation results show that the efficiency of our FHE scheme and implementation of private decision tree classification are more efficient than other two schemes. © 2013 IEEE."

MLaaS applications often rely on centralised collection and aggregation of user data, which could lead to significant privacy concerns when dealing with sensitive personal data. To address this problem, we propose PrivEdge, a technique for privacy-preserving MLaaS that safeguards the privacy of users who provide their data for training, as well as users who use the prediction service. With PrivEdge, each user independently uses their private data to locally train a one-class reconstructive adversarial network that succinctly represents their training data. As sending the model parameters to the service provider in the clear would reveal private information, PrivEdge secret-shares the parameters among two non-colluding MLaaS providers, to then provide cryptographically private prediction services through secure multi-party computation techniques. We quantify the benefits of PrivEdge and compare its performance with state-of-the-art centralised architectures on three privacy-sensitive image-based tasks: individual identification, writer identification, and handwritten letter recognition. Experimental results show that PrivEdge has high precision and recall in preserving privacy, as well as in distinguishing between private and non-private images.

Proteome-wide identification of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) has proven valuable in the systematic understanding of the genome-phenome relationship. However, the PPIs of C. parvum are largely unknown because of the limited experimental studies carried out. Therefore, we took full advantage of three bioinformatics methods, i.e., interolog mapping (IM), domain-domain interaction (DDI)-based inference, and machine learning (ML) method, to jointly predict PPIs of C. parvum. Due to the lack of experimental PPIs of C. parvum, we used the PPI data of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), which owned the largest number of PPIs in Apicomplexa, to train an ML model to infer C. parvum PPIs. We utilized consistent results of these three methods as the predicted high-confidence PPI network, which contains 4,578 PPIs covering 554 proteins. To further explore the biological significance of the constructed PPI network, we also conducted essential network and protein functional analysis, mainly focusing on hub proteins and functional modules. We anticipate the constructed PPI network can become an important data resource to accelerate the functional genomics studies of C. parvum as well as offer new hints to the target discovery in developing drugs/vaccines. © 2022 The Author(s)"

There are many algorithms for price prediction for crypto currencies like LSTM and ARIMA. However, the downside is that LSTM-based RNNs are difficult to comprehend, and gaining intuition into their behavior is tough. In order to produce decent outcomes, rigorous hyperparameter adjustment is also essential. Furthermore, crypto currencies do not precisely adhere to past data, and patterns change fast, reducing the accuracy of predictions. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Because the data is dynamic and heavily influenced by various seasons, the ARIMA model is unable to handle seasonal data. In order to provide better price predictions for crypto traders, a new model is required. The objective of the study is to apply Fbprophet model as the key model because it is superior in functionality as compared to LSTM and ARIMA additionally removing the pitfalls generated in LSTM and ARIMA model while analyzing the cryptocurrency data. This study provides a methodology for predicting the future price of bitcoin that does not rely solely on past data due to seasonality in historical data. So, after fitting the seasonality and smoothing, the model is constructed that can be useful for real-world use cases. In case of crypto currencies where less historical data is available and it is hard to find pattern, proposed method can easily deal this type of problems.

This paper presents a novel approach for de-anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilized a sample of 957 entities (with ≈385 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 12 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm with default parameters, we achieve a mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.42% and F1-score of ≈79.64%. We show two examples, one where we predict on a set of 22 clusters that are suspected to be related to cybercriminal activities, and another where we classify 153,293 clusters to provide an estimation of the activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

resilient machine learning for networked cyber physical systems: a survey for machine learning security to securing machine learning for cps,"olowononi, fo; rawat, db; liu, c",ieee communications surveys and tutorials,2021,10.1109/COMST.2020.3036778,security; computer security; machine learning; wireless sensor networks; resilience; sensor systems; computers; adversarial attacks; cybersecurity; machine learning; resiliency in cyber physical systems,47,Journal,Q1,"Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are characterized by their ability to integrate the physical and information or cyber worlds. Their deployment in critical infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However, harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment. An attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending information from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium, thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most research work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS. However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain functional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant methodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient. This article is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions between resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper concludes with a number of research trends and promising future research directions. Furthermore, with this article, readers can have a thorough understanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area."
reversible data hiding in encrypted images based on adaptive prediction and labeling,"qin j., he z., xiang x., xiong n.n.","computers, materials and continua",2022,10.32604/cmc.2022.030372,adaptive gradient prediction; embedding capacity; huffman coding; reversible data hiding,0,Journal,Q2,"Recently, reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) based on pixel prediction has been a hot topic. However, existing schemes still employ a pixel predictor that ignores pixel changes in the diagonal direction during prediction, and the pixel labeling scheme is inflexible. To solve these problems, this paper proposes reversible data hiding in encrypted images based on adaptive prediction and labeling. First, we design an adaptive gradient prediction (AGP), which uses eight adjacent pixels and combines four scanning methods (i.e., horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and diagonal) for prediction. AGP can adaptively adjust the weight of the linear prediction model according to the weight of the edge attribute of the pixel, which improves the prediction ability of the predictor for complex images. At the same time, we adopt an adaptive huffman coding labeling scheme, which can adaptively generate huffman codes for labeling according to different images, effectively improving the scheme's embedding performance on the dataset. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a higher embedding rate. The embedding rate on the test image Jetplane is 4.2102 bpp, and the average embedding rate on the image dataset Bossbase is 3.8625 bpp. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved."

The existing studies on Bitcoin price prediction are mainly in two ways: (1) study how economic factors, market and investor sentiment indicators influence Bitcoin price; (2) apply machine learning and artificial neural networks to predict the value of Bitcoin. This paper aims to implement a scenario analysis method to generate various hypothetical events and then determine their effects on the value of Bitcoin price. Scenario analysis is normally used to measure financial risk. In this paper, we propose a method that combines scenario analysis with historical data. We further aim to find the correlations among scenarios and examine the relationship between the significant shocks and Bitcoin prices.

Simply centralizing these multi-sourced data for training would raise critical security and privacy concerns, and might be prohibited given the increasingly strict data regulations. To resolve the tension between privacy and data utilization in distributed learning, a machine learning framework called private aggregation of teacher ensembles (PATE) has been recently proposed. PATE harnesses the knowledge (label predictions for an unlabeled dataset) from distributed teacher models to train a student model, obviating access to distributed datasets. Despite being enticing, PATE does not offer protection for the individual label predictions from teacher models, which still entails privacy risks. In this paper, we propose SEDML, a new protocol which allows to securely and efficiently harness the distributed knowledge in machine learning. SEDML builds on lightweight cryptography and provides strong protection for the individual label predictions, as well as differential privacy guarantees on the aggregation results. Extensive evaluations show that while providing privacy protection, SEDML preserves the accuracy as in the plaintext baseline. Meanwhile, SEDML outperforms the state-of-the-art work of Xiang et al.

Cryptocurrency works similar to standard currency, however, virtual payments are made for goods and services without the intervention of any central authority. Although cryptocurrency ensures legitimate and unique transactions by utilizing cryptographic methods, this industry is still in its inception and serious concerns have been raised about its use. Analysis of the sentiments about cryptocurrency is highly desirable to provide a holistic view of peoples' perceptions. In this regard, this study performs both sentiment analysis and emotion detection using the tweets related to the cryptocurrency which are widely used for predicting the market prices of cryptocurrency. For increasing the efficacy of the analysis, a deep learning ensemble model LSTM-GRU is proposed that combines two recurrent neural networks applications including long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). LSTM and GRU are stacked where the GRU is trained on the features extracted by LSTM. Utilizing term frequency-inverse document frequency, word2vec, and bag of words (BoW) features, several machine learning and deep learning approaches and a proposed ensemble model are investigated. Furthermore, TextBlob and Text2Emotion are studied for emotion analysis with the selected models. Comparatively, a larger number of people feel happy with the use of cryptocurrency, followed by fear and surprise emotions. Results suggest that the performance of machine learning models is comparatively better when BoW features are used. The proposed LSTM-GRU ensemble shows an accuracy of 0.99 for sentiment analysis, and 0.92 for emotion prediction and outperforms both machine learning and state-of-the-art models. © 2013 IEEE."

However, one may claim that the actual deployment of e-Voting is at its infancy, mainly due to election integrity issues such as vote non-tampering, voter anonymity, and vote verifiability. The integration of cryptography and blockchain technology in a single framework could provide a solid foundation for secure, anonymous and still verifiable electronic voting. The TrustedEVoting (TeV) framework is a blockchain-based eVoting approach, which wraps not only the required key elements for secure and verifiable e-Voting but also additional features such as support for re-voting and post-election vote check, among others. This paper presents a novel feature to be integrated in TeV, the smart voting ballot, that implements a rankedchoice voting by allowing the voter to cast two votes: a primary vote and an alternative vote. The latter one is utilized in the case the primary vote went to an election party that didn't reach the threshold. In this way, a more flexible voting scheme is available to a voter, mitigating the voter reluctancy to vote for smaller parties. In order to protect the voter's privacy by not revealing trends/preferences/statistics regarding the two votes, an intelligent mechanism is in place that provides a privacy shield for the alternative votes not being used in the voting tallying."

These transformations are performed in two successive stages: The first stage is based on the smoothing technique for the development of a new de-noised version of the original series in which every value contains dynamic knowledge of the all previous values. The second stage of transformations is performed on the smoothed series and it is based on differencing the series in order to be stationary and be considerably easier fitted and analyzed by a deep learning model.

With the rise of speech related machine learning applications over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in developing speech based tools that perform non-invasive diagnosis. This talk covers two aspects related to this growing trend. One is the collection of large in-the-wild multimodal datasets in which the speech of the subject is affected by certain medical conditions. Our mining effort has been focused on video blogs (vlogs), and explores audio, video, text and metadata cues, in order to retrieve vlogs that include a single speaker which, at some point, admits that he/she is currently affected by a given disease. The second aspect is patient privacy. In this context, we explore recent developments in cryptography and, in particular in Fully Homomorphic Encryption, to develop an encrypted version of a neural network trained with unencrypted data, in order to produce encrypted predictions of health-related labels. As a proof-of-concept, we have selected two target diseases: Cold and Depression, to show our results and discuss these two aspects."

The video streaming session is subdivided into a stream of short time slots of 1s length, while considering two additional macro windows each for the current streaming trend and the whole ongoing streaming session. Constant memory features are extracted from the encrypted network traffic in these three windows in a stream-based fashion, and fed into a random forest model, which predicts whether the current time slot contains stalling or not. The presented system can predict stalling with a very high accuracy and the finest granularity to date (1s), and thus, can be used in networks for real-time QoE analysis from encrypted YouTube video streaming traffic. The independent predictions for each consecutive slot of a streaming session can further be aggregated to obtain stalling estimations for the whole session. Thereby, the proposed method allows to quantify the initial delay, as well as the overall number of stalling events and the stalling ratio, i.e., the ratio of total stalling time and total playback time. © 2019 IEEE."

Literature shows that business analysts always tend to use new technologies and investigate their risks. Some researchers predicted the price fluctuations and investigated the risk of cryptocurrency and blockchain network. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study which provides the feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The other cryptocurrencies are not included in the study because of having insufficient relevant data on the social forums. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Apart from that, the public perception and environment feasibility are also determined. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden shows positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment. Which ranks the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the significant terms are also determined using Topic modeling from public opinions. Such as authorization rules, investment, profit, volatility, and security etc. These terms are almost identified as subtopic for each of the inquired keyword.

There are many statistical methods and machine learning algorithms proposed to forecast the cost of bitcoin, but they were lacking to predict the correct result when the input data set is larger and has more noise. To handle large data set, a deep learning technique has been used. The deep learning algorithms, especially LSTM network, also have some drawbacks such as high computational time, inability to generate higher quality prediction result. To avoid these shortcomings and make LSTM a better model for bitcoin prediction, it is necessary to optimize LSTM network.

BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems.

tapas: tricks to accelerate (encrypted) prediction as a service,"sanyal a., kusner m.j., gascón a., kanade v.","35th international conference on machine learning, icml 2018",2018,,,9,Conference,CORE - A*,"Machine learning methods are widely used for a variety of prediction problems. Prediction as a service is a paradigm in which service providers with technological expertise and computational resources may perform predictions for clients. However, data privacy severely restricts the applicability of such services, unless measures to keep client data private (even from the service provider) are designed. Equally important is to minimize the amount of computation and communication required between client and server. Fully homomprphic encryption offers a possible way out, whereby clients may encrypt their data, and on which the server may perform arithmetic computations. The main drawback of using fully homomorphic encryption is the amount of time required to evaluate large machine learning models on encrypted data.

The quality of a project affects the trust in the platform, and therefore the value of the digital tokens exchanged over it. In this paper, we investigate whether developers’ emotions can effectively provide insights that can improve the prediction of the price of tokens. We consider developers’ comments and activity for two major blockchain projects, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, extracted from Github. We measure sentiment and emotions (joy, love, anger, etc.) of the developers’ comments over time, and test the corresponding time series (i.e. the affect time series) for correlations and causality with the Bitcoin/Ethereum time series of prices. Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers’ emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price. Moreover, using an artificial recurrent neural network (LSTM), we can show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)—associated with the prediction of the prices of cryptocurrencies—significantly decreases when including the affect time series. © 2020, The Author(s)."

Under the assumption that the cryptocurrency market has unobserved heterogeneity, an HMM allows us to study (1) the extent to which cryptocurrency markets shift due to interactions with social sentiment during a bull or bear market and (2) the heterogeneous pattern of cryptocurrency market behavior under these two market conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors advance the HMM model based on two six-month datasets (from November 2017 to April 2018 for a bull market and from December 2018 to May 2019 for a bear market) collected from Google, Twitter, the stock market and cryptocurrency trading platforms in South Korea. Social sentiment data were collected by crawling Bitcoin-related posts on Twitter. Findings: The authors highlight the reaction of the cryptocurrency market to social sentiment under a bull and a bear market and in two hidden states (an upward and a downward trend). They find: (1) social sentiment is relatively relevant during a bull compared to a bear market. (2) The cryptocurrency market in a downward state, that is, with a local decreasing trend, tends to be more responsive to positive social sentiment. (3) The market in an upward state, that is, with a local increasing trend, tends to better interact with negative social sentiment. Originality/value: The proposed HMM model contributes to a theoretically grounded understanding of how cryptocurrency markets respond to social sentiment in bull and bear markets through varied sequences adjusted for cryptocurrency market heterogeneity. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

However, much less work has been performed around the security of edge AI. Machine learning models are a mass of intellectual property, and an optimized network is very valuable. Trained machine learning models need to be black boxes as well because they may give away information about the training data to the outside world. As selecting the appropriate activation functions to enable fast training of accurate deep neural networks is an active area of research, it is important to conceal the information of the activation functions used in a neural network architecture as well. There has been research on the use of physical attacks such as the side-channel attack (SCA) in areas other than cryptography. The SCA is highly effective against edge artificial intelligence due to its property of the device computing close to the user. We studied a previously proposed method to retrieve the activation functions of a black box neural network implemented on an edge device by using simple electromagnetic analysis (SEMA) and improved the signal processing procedure for further noisy measurements. The SEMA attack identifies activation functions by directly observing distinctive electromagnetic (EM) traces that correspond to the operations in the activation function. This method requires few executions and inputs and also has little implementation dependency on the activation functions. We distinguished eight similar activation functions with EM measurements and examined the versatility and limits of this attack.

In the other direction, Granger-causality runs from the cryptocurrency price to queries statistics across nearly all frequencies. In both directions, the reaction time computed from a phase delay measure for the relevant frequency bands with significant causality ranges from about 1 to 4 months. For either direction, out-of-sample forecasts are more accurate than forecasts of a benchmark stochastic process.

time series classification of cryptocurrency price trend based on a recurrent lstm neural network,"kwon, dh; kim, jb; heo, js; kim, cm; han, yh",journal of information processing systems,2019,10.3745/JIPS.03.0120,classification; gradient boosting; long short-term memory; time series analysis,21,Journal,Q3,"In this study, we applied the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to classify the cryptocurrency price time series. We collected historic cryptocurrency price time series data and preprocessed them in order to make them clean for use as train and target data. After such preprocessing, the price time series data were systematically encoded into the three-dimensional price tensor representing the past price changes of cryptocurrencies. We also presented our LSTM model structure as well as how to use such price tensor as input data of the LSTM model. In particular, a grid search-based k-fold cross-validation technique was applied to find the most suitable LSTM model parameters. Lastly, through the comparison of the f1-score values, our study showed that the LSTM model outperforms the gradient boosting model, a general machine learning model known to have relatively good prediction performance, for the time series classification of the cryptocurrency price trend. With the LSTM model, we got a performance improvement of about 7% compared to using the GB model."

Numerous usage examples, including the economy, the weather, stock prices, and the development of a corporation, demonstrate its significance. Experiments with time series forecasting utilizing machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and AutoML are conducted in this paper. Its primary contribution consists of addressing the forecasting problem by experimenting with additional ML and DL models and AutoML frameworks and expanding the AutoML experimental knowledge. In addition, it contributes by breaking down barriers found in past experimental studies in this field by using more sophisticated methods. The datasets this empirical research utilized were secondary quantitative data of the real prices of the currently most used cryptocurrencies. We found that AutoML for timeseries is still in the development stage and necessitates more study to be a viable solution since it was unable to outperform manually designed ML and DL models.

One of the main problems with decentralized cryptocurrencies is price volatility, which indicates the need for studying the underlying price model. Moreover, Bitcoin prices exhibit non-stationary behavior, where the statistical distribution of data changes over time. This paper demonstrates high-performance machine learning-based classification and regression models for predicting Bitcoin price movements and prices in short and medium terms. In previous works, machine learning-based classification has been studied for an only one-day time frame, while this work goes beyond that by using machine learning-based models for one, seven, thirty and ninety days. The developed models are feasible and have high performance, with the classification models scoring up to 65% accuracy for next-day forecast and scoring from 62 to 64% accuracy for seventh-ninetieth-day forecast. For daily price forecast, the error percentage is as low as 1.44%, while it varies from 2.88 to 4.10% for horizons of seven to ninety days. These results indicate that the presented models outperform the existing models in the literature."

The forks we consider here are: Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), Bitcoin Private (BTCP), Bitcoin Atom (BCA), and Bitcoin SV (BSV). From the results, we can state that, for most cryptocurrencies studied here, the number of tweets follows the price trend more closely than the sentiment evolution does.The findings can have practical implications for both researchers and practitioners, indeed the results: (i) can be a stepping stone for future research on hard forks, (ii) can help practitioners identify the relevant indicators for hard forks price evolution. © 2022 IEEE."

Hence, it is essential to implement security schemes and to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of electronic circuits. Toward this end, the concept of physically unclonable functions (PUFs) has been established at the beginning of the 21st century. However, most PUFs have eventually, at least partially, fallen short of their promises, which are unpredictability, unclonability, uniqueness, reproducibility, and tamper resilience. That is because most PUFs directly utilize the underlying microelectronics, but that intrinsic randomness can be limited and may thus be predicted, especially by machine learning. Optical PUFs, in contrast, are still considered as promising-they can derive strong, hard-to-predict randomness independently from microelectronics, by using some kind of âoptical token.â Here, we propose a novel concept for plasmonics-enhanced optical PUFs, or peo-PUFs in short. For the first time, we leverage two highly nonlinear phenomena in conjunction by construction: first, light propagation in a silicon disk resonator, and second, surface plasmons arising from nanoparticles arranged randomly on top of the resonator. We elaborate on the physical phenomena, provide simulation results, and conduct a security analysis of peo-PUFs for secure key generation and authentication. This study highlights the good potential of peo-PUFs, and our future work is to focus on fabrication and characterization of such PUFs."

The Bitcoin network creates a complex system of economic incentives that governs its inner working, impacting the network's security guarantees and its evolution. Recent development of Bitcoin as a speculative asset and the herein skyrocketing Bitcoin price greatly incentivize participation in the network. We posit that the expansion in Bitcoin miner population and speculative transactions may not be socially desirable. The increased competition in Bitcoin mining not only exacerbates energy consumption and environmental cost, but also makes the risky mining business much riskier. In addition to the risk of unstable reward flows, the fluctuation in Bitcoin price makes the profitability of mining more uncertain. This research studies an alternative socially optimal model for the Bitcoin market (and other cryptocurrencies in general). Through equilibrium analysis, we emphasize the need to limit speculation in Bitcoin transactions, improve efficiency, diversify currency portfolio, and minimize negative externalities of the Bitcoin mining business."

To address these problems, we demonstrate a generally applicable Distributed Privacy-Preserving Prediction (DPPP) framework, in which instead of sharing more sensitive data or model parameters, an untrusted aggregator combines only multiple models' predictions under provable privacy guarantee. Our framework integrates two main techniques to guarantee individual privacy. First, we introduce the improved Binomial Mechanism and Discrete Gaussian Mechanism to achieve distributed differential privacy. Second, we utilize homomorphic encryption to ensure that the aggregator learns nothing but the noisy aggregated prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework has comparable performance to the non-private frameworks and delivers better results than the local differentially private framework and standalone framework. © 2020 IEEE."

The appalling nature of Ethereum transactions to have both, security and threat at a comparable level, demands analytics for inferring traits for better perspectives and insights. This research work focuses on characteristic analysis of Ethereum transaction space for inferring behavioural traits in supervised and unsupervised context. In an unsupervised environment, raw transaction data is extradited to a tabular transaction structure by selecting appropriate features. The data is further clustered and validated to form coherent groupings of similar patterns. The clusters are characteristically analyzed based on the features through Radar plots for inferring behavioural traits. In supervised context, labelled transactions are represented using histograms and feature-based characteristic analysis is performed to infer traits. Such analytics lay foundations for future deeper analysis that can be used to discover trends and patterns to understand the transaction network, enhancement of trading strategies, identification of bot activities, anomaly detection and several others."

To address these issues, we propose a transfer learning method based on Efficientnet to detect the encrypted malicious traffic. Efficientnet-B0, a pre-trained model based on the Imagenet dataset, is transferred to an encrypted traffic dataset, extracting features automatically from the original traffic data without expert experience.

Namely, it allows a buyer to purchase an item from a seller without disclosing to the latter which item was purchased and at which price. Unfortunately, existing POT schemes have some drawbacks in terms of design and functionality. First, the design of existing POT schemes is not modular. Typically, a POT scheme extends a k-out-of-N oblivious transfer (OT) scheme by adding prices to the items. However, all POT schemes do not use OT as a black-box building block with certain security guarantees. Consequently, security of the OT scheme needs to be reanalyzed while proving security of the POT scheme, and it is not possible to swap the underlying OT scheme with any other OT scheme. Second, existing POT schemes do not allow the seller to obtain any kind of statistics about the buyer's purchases, which hinders customer and sales management. Moreover, the seller is not able to change the prices of items without restarting the protocol from scratch. We propose a POT scheme that addresses the aforementioned drawbacks. We prove the security of our POT in the UC framework. We modify a standard POT functionality to allow the seller to receive aggregate statistics about the buyer's purchases and to change prices dynamically. We present a modular construction for POT that realizes our functionality in the hybrid model. One of the building blocks is an ideal functionality for OT. Therefore, our protocol separates the tasks carried out by the underlying OT scheme from the additional tasks needed by a POT scheme. Thanks to that, our protocol is a good example of modular design and can be instantiated with any secure OT scheme as well as other building blocks without reanalyzing security from scratch."

The results demonstrated that ARIMA outperforms most other methods in predicting cryptocurrency prices on a daily time series basis in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

using machine learning to predict stealthy watermarks in files during cyber crime investigations,"sabir m.f., jones j.h., liu h., mbaziira a.v.",acm international conference proceeding series,2019,10.1145/3314545.3314561,data hiding; digital forensics; machine learning; naive bayes; stealthy watermarking; support vector machines,1,Conference,CORE - A*,"Digital evidence continues to be an integral component in cybercrime investigative and judicial processes. However, increasing volume digital content and files makes it challenging for forensic examiners to process evidence in a timely way. In this paper, we use machine learning to predict stealthy watermarks in various file types. We use a black box approach which is different from current steganographic and cryptographic methods to find patterns of candidate file locations for hidden data. The results in this paper demonstrate that it is possible to use machine learning to build singleton models of the same file type as well as hybrid models to predict stealthy watermarks in files. In our experiments, the DOCX singleton models predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 40% to 100%. The PPTX singleton model predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 32.5%) to 100%. Similarly, the JPEG singleton model predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 37.5% to 65%. We also generated four types of hybrid models: both HYBID3 and JPEG-PPTX models predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 47.5% to 92.5% while HYBRID-OOXML model predicted stealthy watermarks with predictive accuracies ranging from 32.5% to 100%. In addition, JPEG-DOCX model predicted stealthy watermarks in files with predictive accuracies ranging from 47.5% to 90%. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery."
using transformers and deep learning with stance detection to forecast cryptocurrency price movement,y. son; s. vohra; r. vakkalagadda; m. zhu; a. hirde; s. kumar; a. rajaram,2022 13th international conference on information and communication technology convergence (ictc),2022,10.1109/ICTC55196.2022.9953018,cryptocurrency;sentiment analysis;stance de-tection;neural networks;natural language processing,0,Conference,IEEE Sponsored,"The volatility of cryptocurrencies and exclusivity of crypto communities has made cryptocurrency investment inaccessible for common people. With machine learning, harnessing social media trends that affect price in a random field like cryptocurrency will provide everybody the ability to earn money. Although existing research utilizes sentiment analysis to label posts based solely on English, this project will use NLP to perform stance detection with respect to a certain entity to make predictions. The second part of this project will apply this stance detection to real-world prices, using an RNN to turn stance data into price data. The stance detection model, RoBERTa, reached an accuracy of 80%. An independent price prediction model using an RNN achieved a mean absolute error of $1144, a relatively minimal error considering that the price of crypto reaches $60000. This endeavor proves the difficulty in proving cryptocurrency prices, but the model's steady improvement indicates that future work on social media trends may be promising after all."
wavelet entropy and complexity analysis of cryptocurrencies dynamics,"vampa, v; martin, mt; calderon, l; bariviera, af",digital era and fuzzy applications in management and economy,2022,10.1007/978-3-030-94485-8_2,cryptocurrencies; long memory; statistical complexity; wavelet entropy,0,Conference,Unranked,"Cryptocurrencies emerged almost one decade ago, as an alternative peer-to-peer payment method. Even though their currency characteristics have been challenged by several researchers, they constitute an important speculative financial asset. This paper examines the long memory properties in high frequency (5 min) time series of eight important cryptocurrencies. We perform a statistical analysis of two key financial characteristics of time series: return and volatility. We compute information theory quantifiers using a wavelet decomposition of the time series: wavelet entropy and wavelet statistical complexity of returns and volatility of each time series. We find two important features in the time series: (i) high frequency returns exhibit a trend toward a more efficient behavior, and (ii) high frequency volatility reflects a strong persistence in volatility. Both findings have important implications for portfolio managers, and investors in general. The presence of persistent volatility validates the use of GARCH-type models. Thus, understanding volatility could create opportunities for short-term day traders."
wavelet-denoised arima and lstm method to predict cryptocurrency price,"sener e., demir i.","ismsit 2022 - 6th international symposium on multidisciplinary studies and innovative technologies, proceedings",2022,10.1109/ISMSIT56059.2022.9932727,arima; cryptocurrency; lstm; machine learning; price prediction; wavelet-denoising,0,Conference,Unranked,"Cryptocurrencies, which occupy a risky position among investment instruments, continue their technological developments day by day with the speed of money transfers and the confidence in the decentralization of production. In this paper, we propose a denoised Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method for predicting cryptocurrency prices. The daily cryptocurrency price data of Bitcoin (BTC) is collected from a freely available website (cryptocompare.com). For the prediction of BTC/USD price, we considered the average values of daily opening, high, low and closing price as OHLC value. The data set is denoised from white noise using the discrete wavelet transform method (DWT) by VisuShrink thresholding on Daubechies (db4) wavelet at level=5. OHLC and denoised OHLC (DOHLC) values are predicted using ARIMA(p,d,q) and LSTM methods. LSTM hyperparameters are evaluated using 28 different combinations. A pair of Adam-linear optimization and activation function is the best hyperparameter with the lowest mean loss value of 1.42e-03. Finally, DLSTM was found to be the best prediction method according to the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) prediction metric: 556.85. © 2022 IEEE."
what drives cryptocurrency prices? an investigation of google trends and telegram sentiment,smuts n.,performance evaluation review,2019,10.1145/3308897.3308955,bitcoin; cryptocurrency; ethereum; google trends; lstm; sentiment; telegram,20,Conference,Journal - Unranked,"The Google Trends 1 search analysis service and the Telegram 2 messaging platform are investigated to determine their respective relationships to cryptocurrency price behaviour. It is shown that, in contrast to earlier findings, the relationship between cryptocurrency price movements and internet search volumes obtained from Google Trends is no longer consistently positive, with strong negative correlations detected for Bitcoin and Ethereum during June 2018. Sentiment extracted from cryptocurrency investment groups on Telegram is found to be positively correlated to Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements, particularly during periods of elevated volatility. The number of messages posted on a Bitcoin-themed Telegram group is found to be an indicator of Bitcoin price action in the subsequent week. A long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is developed to predict the direction of cryptocurrency prices using data obtained from Google Trends and Telegram. It is shown that Telegram data is a better predictor of the direction of the Bitcoin market than Google Trends. The converse is true for Ethereum. The LSTM model produces the most accurate results when predicting price movements over a one-week period. Copyright is held by author/owner(s)."
"when a rf beats a cnn and gru, together—a comparison of deep learning and classical machine learning approaches for encrypted malware traffic classification","lichy a., bader o., dubin r., dvir a., hajaj c.",computers and security,2023,10.1016/j.cose.2022.103000,deep learning; encrypted traffic classification; machine learning; malware classification; malware detection,0,Journal,Q1,"Internet traffic classification plays a crucial role in Quality of Experience (QoE), Quality of Services (QoS), intrusion detection, and traffic-trend analyses. While there is no theoretical guarantee that deep learning (DL)-based solutions perform better than classic machine learning (ML)-based ones, DL-based models have become the common default. This paper compares well-known DL-based and ML-based models and shows that in the case of malicious traffic classification, state-of-the-art DL-based solutions do not necessarily outperform the classical ML-based ones. We exemplify this finding using two well-known datasets for a varied set of tasks, such as: malware detection, malware family classification, detection of zero-day attacks, and classification of an iteratively growing dataset. Note that, it is not feasible to evaluate all possible models to make a concrete statement, thus the above finding is not a recommendation to avoid DL-based models, but rather an empirical finding that in some cases, there are more simplistic solutions, that may perform even better. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
