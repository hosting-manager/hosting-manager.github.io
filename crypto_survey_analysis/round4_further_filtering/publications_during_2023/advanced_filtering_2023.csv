a comparison of machine learning and econometric models for pricing perpetual bitcoin futures and their application to algorithmic trading,"malik, a",expert systems,2023,10.1111/exsy.13414,bitcoin; garch; har; machine learning; pricing futures contracts; random forest; support vector machine; trading; volatility,0,Journal,Q2,"Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures contracts are highly leveraged speculative trading instruments with daily market trading of $45 Billion. BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts, which depend upon the underlying BTC SPOT (current) price. Pricing perpetual futures fairly is hard, using traditional arbitrage arguments, because of the volatile nature of the so called funding rate, which is used as the replacement of risk free rate in the Cryptocurrency market. This work presents a novel technique for pricing BTC futures contracts using conditional volatility and mean models. Intra-day high-frequency futures' return volatility and mean are modelled using different ML and econometric techniques. A comparison is made using statistical measures to find the model that best captures the intra-day conditional mean and volatility. Exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity is shown to be an almost unbiased predictor of intra-day volatility, while a constant autoregressive moving average (0, 0) model best captures the conditional mean of the returns. A market directional high frequency trading algorithm is developed using the volatility and mean models. The algorithm first prices the futures contract at some future point of time using the volatility and mean regression models. Next, the slope between the current futures price and the expected price are used to predict the market direction. A long or short position is taken depending upon the expected market direction movement. Extensive back-testing results show absolute returns of 1500%-8000% depending upon the transaction fees and leverage used. On average, the market direction is predicted correctly 85% of the time by the best model. Finally, the trading technique is market neutral, in that it gives large positive returns, with low SD, in both bull and bear markets."

It has gained immense popularity and has attracted a huge consumer base owing to its ever-increasing market capitalization. This has led to many traders and investors being interested in knowing the future prices of these cryptocurrencies to gain profits. Researchers have contributed several works in the field of predicting the future cryptocurrency but with very low accuracy. The aim of this paper is to propose a bitcoin price prediction model which will help predict the future prices of bitcoin. Different deep-learning models are involved in the proposed prediction model namely Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU), Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM).

a forecasting approach to cryptocurrency price index using reinforcement learning,"mariappan l.t., pandian j.a., kumar v.d., geman o., chiuchisan i., năstase c.",applied sciences (switzerland),2023,10.3390/app13042692,bitcoin; blockchain; forecasting; mortgage lender; reinforcement learning,0,Journal,Q3,"Cryptocurrency has emerged as a well-known significant component with both economic and financial potential in recent years. Unfortunately, Bitcoin acquisition is not simple, due to uneven business and significant rate fluctuations. Traditional approaches to price forecasting have proven incapable of proving adequate data and solutions because prices can now be forecast in real time. We recommended a machine learning-based alternative for a mortgage lender based on highlighted problems in forecasting the price of Bitcoin. The proposed system included a reinforcement learning algorithm for price estimation and forecasting, as well as a blockchain framework for an efficient and secure environment. The proposed prediction, compared to other state-of-the-art strategies in this sector, demonstrated better performance. In this system, the proposed prediction reached improved consistency, in comparison to other systems, with respect to Monero (XMR), Litecoin (LTC), Oryen (ORY), and Bitcoin (BTC). © 2023 by the authors."
a new method of ensemble learning: case of cryptocurrency price prediction,rather a.m.,knowledge and information systems,2023,10.1007/s10115-022-01796-0,cryptocurrency; decision tree; deep neural networks; machine learning; support vector regression,0,Journal,Q2,"This work proposes a novel method of ensemble learning for time series prediction. Different machine learning-based models have been integrated, and a combined prediction model has been created. The objective of the ensemble model is that it must outperform all other individual models that are used to construct the ensemble model in terms of producing excellent predictions. The field of cryptocurrencies has been selected as the domain of this work where the focus is to predict the cryptocurrency prices using the proposed model. A new regression model is proposed and implemented in this work. Different machine learning techniques have been adopted and integrated to form a combined prediction model. The machine learning models include deep neural networks, support vector regression, and decision trees. The regression scheme has to be implemented on each machine learning model separately as well as their performance is also to be improved. The combined prediction model requires optimal weights generation for integration, and therefore, time complexity is a concern. A large set of experiments have been carried out on various cryptocurrencies and the results are displayed. Real-world data has been used here and a comparison is also performed. It is observed that the combined prediction model outperforms other models resulting in excellent predictions capturing most of the nonstationary movements in the data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
a novel cryptocurrency price time series hybrid prediction model via machine learning with matlab/simulink,zhao l.; li z.; ma y.; qu l.,journal of supercomputing,2023,10.1007/s11227-023-05242-y,cryptocurrency price; machine learning; time complexity; time series hybrid prediction model (tshpm); vmd,0,Journal,Q2,"Bitcoin is widely recognized as the first decentralized digital cryptocurrency based on blockchain technology. Its unique properties make it a leading contender in the realm of digital currencies, and it continues to maintain a dominant position in the short-term. However, the high volatility of bitcoin prices poses significant challenges for prediction models. Therefore, it is important to develop rational processing techniques to weaken the volatility of raw data, thereby facilitating more accurate predictions. To this end, we propose a novel time series hybrid prediction model (TSHPM) to estimate bitcoin prices. Our approach utilizes variational mode decomposition (VMD) to decompose daily bitcoin prices into several simple modes. We then use approximate entropy (ApEn) for modal characterization and sequence reconstruction to determine the complexity of the different components of the time series. To better compare the accuracy of different models, we establish a comprehensive evaluation index (CEI). Furthermore, we adopt an innovative approach by utilizing the Simulink module in MATLAB for machine learning prediction. Through a rigorous selection process, we identify the appropriate model that produces the best prediction. Among them, the VMD-LSTM-Adam model has the best prediction performance with a CEI value of only 0.4017. Empirical analysis demonstrates that our TSHPM approach significantly outperforms traditional prediction methods, reducing prediction errors by more than 50%. At the same time, the time complexity of the prediction is optimized by about 15% and the overall performance of the model is greatly improved. In summary, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the TSHPM model in predicting complex time series, particularly bitcoin prices. Our approach provides a promising avenue for further research in the field of cryptocurrency price prediction, with the potential to facilitate more accurate and reliable predictions in future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
a novel fading-memory filter multiple trading strategy with data-driven innovation volatility,y. liang; a. thavaneswaran; a. paseka; s. bowala; j. liyau,"2023 ieee 47th annual computers, software, and applications conference (compsac)",2023,10.1109/COMPSAC57700.2023.00206,pairs trading;multiple trading;fading-memory filter;kalman filter;resilient filter;data-driven volatility;high frequency;cryptocurrency,0,Conference,CORE - B,"A profitable data-driven algorithmic trading algorithm will benefit from a dynamic system that can produce accurate hedge ratio estimates and short-term innovation volatility forecasts. Commonly used pairs and multiple trading strategies are constructed using the Kalman Filter (KF) and exploiting mean reversion in co-integrated nonstationary stock prices. However, KFs are sensitive to model errors. Misspecified modelling produces unstable solutions for dynamic systems. Fading-Memory Filter (FMF) uses a discounting weight to past observations. Compared to a standard KF, FMF addresses more recent observations and is more resilient (less sensitive) to modelling errors. However, the FMF algorithm does not provide slope parameter covariance matrix updates and innovation volatility forecasts. This paper proposes a novel resilient FMF algorithm for pairs trading and multiple trading by defining an appropriate data-driven innovation volatility forecasting model. The FMF-based strategies are implemented through some experiments on the hourly prices (high-frequency data) of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. It is shown that the proposed FMF trading strategies outperform the existing KF trading strategies and they are more profitable in the bear market over time, especially for continuous falling of prices and the short-lived and sharp rally recovery where prices are not stationary."
a novel hybrid deep learning model for price prediction,"abdullah w., salah a.",international journal of electrical and computer engineering,2023,10.11591/ijece.v13i3.pp3420-3431,deep leaning; machine learning; price prediction; statistical models; time series analysis,0,Journal,Q2,"Price prediction has become a major task due to the explosive increase in the number of investors. The price prediction task has various types such as shares, stocks, foreign exchange instruments, and cryptocurrency. The literature includes several models for price prediction that can be classified based on the utilized methods into three main classes, namely, deep learning, machine learning, and statistical. In this context, we proposed several models’ architectures for price prediction. Among them, we proposed a hybrid one that incorporates long short-term memory (LSTM) and Convolution neural network (CNN) architectures, we called it CNN-LSTM. The proposed CNN-LSTM model makes use of the characteristics of the convolution layers for extracting useful features embedded in the time series data and the ability of LSTM architecture to learn long-term dependencies. The proposed architectures are thoroughly evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art methods on three different types of financial product datasets for stocks, foreign exchange instruments, and cryptocurrency. The obtained results show that the proposed CNN-LSTM has the best performance on average for the utilized evaluation metrics. Moreover, the proposed deep learning models were dominant in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, machine learning models, and statistical models. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

a temporal graph framework for intelligence extraction in social media networks,"chung w., lai v.s.",information and management,2023,10.1016/j.im.2023.103773,github; modeling; primacy; psychological theory; recency; social media analytics; social media networks; social theory,0,Journal,Q1,"Social media networks (SMNs) are increasingly used in professional management of knowledge workers and related assets. However, the factors affecting behavioral trends and activity levels in these networks are not well understood. Although social and cognitive theories can help to explain human behavior in traditional social networks, their application to SMNs has not been validated. Traditional social network modeling techniques may not accurately predict real-world SMN activities. This research developed a temporal graph framework for intelligence extraction in SMNs. Theory-based, data-driven models (Conformity Model (COM), Recency-Primacy Model (REM), Trend Interaction Model (TIM), Periodic Interaction Model (PIM)) were developed based on the framework to capture various aspects of user behavior: conformity effect, recency, primacy, periodicity, and dynamic trend. The models capture the activity history and dynamically combine pricing information to enhance predictive accuracy. Using data of 83,536 GitHub software repositories on cryptocurrency, this article reports the results of experiments that compare the models’ performance in predicting SMN activities over time. Experimental results show that the model (REM) that captures recency/primacy effects of human cognitive processing outperformed other models in 9 (out of 18) measures pertaining to engagement, contribution, influence, and popularity. Primacy plays a dominant role in predicting engagement, contribution, and popularity, whereas recency plays a key role in predicting influence. Short-term trend (modeled with TIM) was found to yield significantly better performance on predicting user contribution. The models also outperformed an integrated machine learning (IML) model by most measures. Overall, the effects modeled by REM and TIM were found to be more significant than the effects modeled by COM, PIM, and IML. The research contributes to enhancing understanding of SMN behavior, developing new models to simulate and predict SMN activities, and designing new artifacts for information systems practitioners to manage knowledge assets and to extract SMN intelligence. © 2023"

Predicted output's accuracy is influenced by the quantity of data since the more data there is, the better the model can predict the output. The results show that with the accuracy score performance metric, which we employed for this study, we were able to calculate the accuracy of the algorithms and find that both algorithms random forest and gradient boosting respectively performed well for the cryptocurrencies such as Solana (98.07%,98.14%), Binance (96.56%, 96.85%), and Ethereum (96.61%, 96.60%)), with the exception of Tether (0.38%, 12.35%) and USD coin (-0.59%, 1.48%), the results demonstrate that both algorithms work effectively with themajority of cryptocurrencies which can be further increased by using deep learning algorithms like ANN, RNN or LSTM."
an elitist artificial electric field algorithm based random vector functional link network for cryptocurrency prices forecasting,nayak s.c.; das s.; dehuri s.; cho s.-b.,ieee access,2023,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3283571,aefa; artificial neural network; bitcoin; cryptocurrency; financial time series forecasting; random vector functional link network,0,Journal,Q1,"Cryptocurrencies have carved out a significant presence in financial transactions during the past few years. Cryptocurrency market performs similarly to other financial markets with considerable nonlinearity and volatility and its prediction is a growing research area. It is challenging to capture the inherent uncertainties connected with cryptocurrency using the currently used conventional methodologies. The popularity of random vector functional link networks (RVFLN) is attributed to its simple structural layout, quick rate of learning, and enhanced generalization ability. It computes the output layer weights using non-iterative techniques like least square methods or iterative techniques like gradient methods, and assigns hidden neuron parameters at random. Random initialization of non-optimal hidden neuron settings, however, degrades the performance. Population-based metaheuristics are a superior option to random initialization for determining the ideal parameters and avoiding the problem of local optima stagnation. In the current article, an elitist artificial electric field algorithm (eAEFA) for training RVFLN is proposed. Here, eAEFA is utilized to create an ideal RVFLN by determining the weights and biases of the hidden layer connections. The elitism method is used by AEFA to maximize its strength. Here, the most suitable entities are directly inserted to create the population of the following generation. By predicting the closing values of six widely used cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, ZEC, XLM, and Ripple, one may determine how well the eAEFA+RVFLN model is performing. For comparison study, models including ARIMA, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), basic RVFLN, support vector regression (SVR), LSTM, GA trained RVFLN, and AEFA trained RVFLN are also constructed concurrently. In terms of performance and statistical significance testing, the suggested eAEFA+RVFLN findings outperform the comparator models. On an average, it achieves a MAPE (mean absolute percentage of error) value of 0.0573, R2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.9589, POCID (prediction of change in direction) of 0.9676, RMSE (root mean squared error) of 0.0685, MAE (mean absolute error) of 0.0727 and an average rank of 1.346; as a result, it is possible to recommend it as a useful financial forecasting tool.  © 2013 IEEE."

Depending on the different types of data and the period, various models are used for prediction. A single model may be the best fit in the short term but may not be the best in long-term series data. Thus, using only a single model may not be suitable for forecasting time series data that depends on data sampling length and prediction time, and the type of specific applications. As a result, the ARIMA model produces better error results with a short prediction period or a small data set. In contrast, the Hybrid ARIMA-SVM model will help improve the performance of the ARIMA model when predicting over a long period, specifically 7 and 30 days for Bitcoin price prediction used in this research paper.

In this study, we focus on finding stable and accurate volatility predictors for a relatively new asset class of cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoin, using deep learning representations of public social media data obtained from Twitter. For our experiments, we extracted semantic information and user statistics from over 30 million Bitcoin-related tweets, in conjunction with 15-minute frequency price data over a horizon of 144 days. Using this data, we built several deep learning architectures that utilized different combinations of the gathered information. For each model, we conducted ablation studies to assess the influence of different components and feature sets over the prediction accuracy. We found statistical evidences for the hypotheses that: (i) temporal convolutional networks perform significantly better than both classical autoregressive models and other deep learning-based architectures in the literature, and (ii) tweet author meta-information, even detached from the tweet itself, is a better predictor of volatility than the semantic content and tweet volume statistics. We demonstrate how different information sets gathered from social media can be utilized in different architectures and how they affect the prediction results.

The predominant tool that traders use to identify profitable opportunities is technical analysis. Some investors and researchers also combined technical analysis with machine learning, in order to forecast upcoming trends in the market. However, even with the use of these methods, developing successful trading strategies is still regarded as an extremely challenging task. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms demonstrated satisfying performance in solving complicated problems, including the formulation of profitable trading strategies. While some DRL techniques have been successful in increasing profit and loss (PNL) measures, these techniques are not much risk-aware and present difficulty in maximizing PNL and lowering trading risks simultaneously. This research proposes the combination of DRL approaches with rule-based safety mechanisms to both maximize PNL returns and minimize trading risk. First, a DRL agent is trained to maximize PNL returns, using a novel reward function. Then, during the exploitation phase, a rule-based mechanism is deployed to prevent uncertain actions from being executed. Finally, another novel safety mechanism is proposed, which considers the actions of a more conservatively trained agent, in order to identify high-risk trading periods and avoid trading. Our experiments on 5 popular cryptocurrencies show that the integration of these three methods achieves very promising results."

Daily financial market indices and price observations are used to assess the forecasting models. We compare statistical, machine learning, and deep learning forecasting models to evaluate the financial markets, such as the ARIMA, hybrid ETS-ANN, and kNN predictive models. The study results indicate that predicting financial market fluctuations is challenging, and the accuracy levels are generally low in several instances. ARIMA and hybrid ETS-ANN models perform better over extended periods compared to the kNN model, with ARIMA being the best-performing model in 2018–2021 and the hybrid ETS-ANN model being the best-performing model in most of the other subperiods. Still, the kNN model outperforms the others in several periods, depending on the observed accuracy measure. Researchers have advocated using parametric and non-parametric modeling combinations to generate better results. In this study, the results suggest that the hybrid ETS-ANN model is the best-performing model despite its moderate level of accuracy.

comparison of trading strategies: dual momentum vs pairs trading,singh j.; thulasiram r.k.; thavaneswaran a.; paseka a.,proceedings - international computer software and applications conference,2023,10.1109/COMPSAC57700.2023.00207,absolute momentum; cointegration; cryptocurrency; dual-momentum; information filtering; momentum investing; pairs trading; relative momentum,0,Conference,CORE - B,"There have been several studies in the literature discussing the profitability with various trading strategies. Two common strategies are pairs trading and momentum strategies. The momentum strategy aims to exploit the phenomenon of momentum, where securities that have performed well in the past are likely to continue performing well in the future. The concept behind a pairs trading of stocks is similar to the statistical idea of cointegration. The goal of pairs trading is to profit from the relative price movements of the two assets, rather than from the absolute price movements of either asset. This strategy is generally implemented using algorithmic trading techniques, and it is often used by traders and investors to take advantage of mispricing in the market. In this study we first compare these two strategies and implement them to study for their profitability. We considered two major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) for these two trading strategies and show that with daily price data, dual momentum strategy generates significantly better results than the pairs trading strategy. © 2023 IEEE."

Only a few researchers have focused on the feasibility to apply various modelling approaches. These approaches may prone to have low convergence issues in outcomes and acquire high computation time. Hence a model is put forward based on machine learning techniques using regression algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization with XGBoost algorithm, for more precise prediction outcomes of three cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum. The approach uses time series that consists of daily price information of cryptocurrencies. In this paper, the XGBoost algorithm is incorporated with an enhanced PSO method to tune the optimal hyper-parameters to yield out better prediction output rate. The comparative assessment delineated that the proposed method shows less root mean squared error, mean absolute error and mean squared error values.

Accordingly, designing a model that can take into account the various significant factors for predicting the Bitcoin price with the highest accuracy is essential. Hence, the current paper uses market sentiment and multiple feature extraction to present several Bitcoin price prediction models based on convolutional neural network and long short-term memory. In the proposed models, several parameters, including Twitter data, news headlines, news content, Google Trends, Bitcoin-based stock, and finance, are employed based on deep learning to make a more accurate prediction. Such parameters are the input data used to predict the Bitcoin price. Besides, the proposed model analyzes the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner sentiments to examine the market's latest news and cryptocurrencies. According to this study's various inputs and analyses, several effective feature selection methods, including mutual information regression, linear regression, correlation-based, and a combination of the feature selection models, are exploited to predict the price of Bitcoin. Finally, a careful comparison is made between the proposed models in terms of some performance criteria like mean square error (MSE), root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, median absolute error, and coefficient of determination (R-2). The obtained results indicate that the proposed hybrid model based on sentiments analysis and combined feature selection with MSE value of 0.001 and R-2 value of 0.98 provides better estimations with more minor errors regarding Bitcoin price. This proposed model can also be employed as an individual assistant for more informed trading decisions associated with Bitcoin."

Cryptocurrency is characterized by significant volatility and asset price fluctuations in the short term. Therefore, the development of an accurate and technologically reliable forecasting approach is important. For accurately predicting the closing price of the cryptocurrency, as a representative digital financial asset, we developed a reconstructed dynamic-bound Levenberg-Marquardt neural network (R-DB-LM-NN) architecture and a corre-sponding neural-network training algorithm with a moving-boundary mechanism for evaluating the correctness of each descent direction. We used a high-frequency blockchain information dataset for training and prediction. The dynamic bound was introduced to increase the step size so that the neural network could effectively cross the local minimum and to avoid interrupting the neural-network iteration process. Then, we built a high-frequency encrypted digital currency blockchain information dataset. Experiments confirmed that the proposed architec-ture and algorithm are superior to traditional neural-network machine-learning methods, such as artificial neural networks, and deep-learning methods, such as long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks, with regard to prediction performance. Finally, the implications of the study and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed, along with the extension of the approach to other time series research domains, for researchers and practitioners."

Three machine learning approaches, namely, neural networks, support vector machines, and gradient boosting approach, are used to further improve the forecasting performance of individual models. By taking data-snooping bias into account, three different metrics are applied to examine the forecasting ability of each model. Our results suggest that the machine learning techniques always outperform the best individual model whereas the gradient boosting framework has the best performance among all the models. Finally, a time-varying leverage trading strategy combined with narrative sentiments and volatility is proposed to enhance trading performance.

Indeed, according to CryptoQuant, almost $80 billion of positions on centralised exchanges were liquidated during 2021, that is an average of over $200 million per day. So hedgers of bitcoin price risk should account for the possibility of automatic liquidation when taking positions on bitcoin futures. We derive a semi-closed form for an optimal hedging strategy with dual objectives – to minimize both the variance of the hedged portfolio and the probability of liquidation due to insufficient collateral. The solution depends on the statistical characteristics of the spot and futures extreme returns, and other parameters that characterize the hedger by choice of leverage, loss aversion and collateral management.

However, due to its extremely high volatility and the lack of a custom Bitcoin trading system, investors find it difficult to establish an effective investment strategy in this market. In this study, we build an intelligent Bitcoin trading system to maximize profitability by predicting the market. We propose a fusion approach combining technology with economic knowledge to achieve accurate predictions. Firstly, we provide an ensemble prediction framework that integrates the AdaBoost algorithm with the LSTM deep learning model as a form of technological convergence. This dramatically improves the predictive performance due to the high representational capacity of LSTM and the overfitting minimization capability of AdaBoost. Secondly, to account for the repeated structural volatility in the market, we combine the econometrics Markov regime-switching model with the AdaBoost-LSTM model to predict the period of market turbulence caused by structural breaks in the regime. Our prediction model suggests that market turbulence lasting longer than 21 days could be a potentially high-risk investment in the future. Finally, we have developed a Bitcoin-customized trading algorithm that maximizes rewards by predicting upward movements in prices and warning of high-risk investments during a long-lasting turbulent regime. In trading tests, our system yielded a cumulative return of 2.4 times and 4.0 times on 1-day and 5-day forecasts, respectively, compared to other representative trading strategies such as the stochastic oscillator. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

In this study, we proposed a hybrid model for predicting the daily close price of cryptocurrencies based on different neural networks such as long short-term memory, convolutional neural network and attention mechanism. Using an ensemble of three pre-trained language models, we extracted sentiment of cryptocurrency-related tweets posted between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021. We constructed 20 different versions of our model and evaluated their performance on data of 27 most traded cryptocurrencies using a history of previous days' sentiment data along with close prices as input data. The flexible input layer of our model enables different ways of feeding data into the model to adjust it for different cryptocurrencies to obtain better predictions. Our analysis revealed several important findings. We showed that longer sequences of input data achieve most accurate predictions on average. More specifically, using a history of 14- and 21-days' data results in lowest RMSE values on average compared to using a history of 7 days. However, there is no significant difference between the results related to the input sequences with lengths of 14 and 21. In addition, our findings suggest that sentiment data can be useful in predicting prices for more than 70% of the studied cryptocurrencies. Thus, peoples' emotions, opinions, and sentiment that are expressed through their posts on Twitter platform play a significant role in prediction of cryptocurrencies' prices."

Nevertheless, predicting the cryptocurrency price accurately can be challenging in the real world. Numerous studies have been undertaken to determine the best model for successful prediction. However, they lacked correct results because they avoided identifying the critical features. It is important to remember that trends are critical features in time series to obtain data information. A dearth of research demonstrates that the cryptocurrency trend comprises linear and nonlinear patterns. Therefore, this study attempted to fill this gap and focused on modelling and forecasting trends in cryptocurrency. This study examined the linear and nonlinear dependency trend patterns of the top five cryptocurrency closing prices. The weekly historical data of each cryptocurrency were taken at different periods due to the availability of data on the system. In achieving its goal, this study examined the results by plotting based on residual trend and diagnostic statistic checking using three deterministic methods: linear trend regression, quadratic trend, and exponential trend. Based on the minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the result showed that the top five cryptocurrency closing price data series contained nonlinear and linear trend patterns.

Second, we use the historical trading data, daily Google Trends, and sentiment indicators to forecast the movement of cryptocurrency prices using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Third, we propose a portfolio optimization model by considering both the forecasting information and the global minimum variance model, and then derive the corresponding portfolio strategy. Finally, we compare the out-of-sample performance of the proposed strategy with classic portfolio strategies and the Cryptocurrency Index.

However, due to their uncertainty, volatility, and dynamism, forecasting crypto prices is a challenging time series analysis task. Researchers have proposed predictors based on statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches, but the literature is limited. Indeed, it is narrow because it focuses on predicting only the prices of the few most famous cryptos. In addition, it is scattered because it compares different models on different cryptos inconsistently, and it lacks generality because solutions are overly complex and hard to reproduce in practice. The main goal of this paper is to provide a comparison framework that overcomes these limitations. We use this framework to run extensive experiments where we compare the performances of widely used statistical, ML, and DL approaches in the literature for predicting the price of five popular cryptocurrencies, i.e., XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Monero (XMR). To the best of our knowledge, we are also the first to propose using the temporal fusion transformer (TFT) on this task. Moreover, we extend our investigation to hybrid models and ensembles to assess whether combining single models boosts prediction accuracy. Our evaluation shows that DL approaches are the best predictors, particularly the LSTM, and this is consistently true across all the cryptos examined. LSTM reaches an average RMSE of (Formula presented.) and MAE of (Formula presented.), respectively, (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) better than the second-best model.

In this study, data from Reddit and LexisNexis, covering a period of more than four years, were collected. These data were utilized to estimate and compare the performance of the six machine learning techniques by adding technical and sentiment indicators to the price data along with the volume of posts. An accuracy of 90.57% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value (AUC) of 97.48% were obtained using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). It was shown that the use of both sentiment index using valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner (VADER) and 11 technical indicators utilizing moving average, relative strength index (RSI), stochastic oscillators in predicting Bitcoin price trends can produce significant results.

prediction of bitcoin price using optimized genetic arima model and analysis in post and pre covid eras*,v. srivastava; v. kumar dwivedi; a. kumar singh,2023 3rd international conference on smart data intelligence (icsmdi),2023,10.1109/ICSMDI57622.2023.00033,bitcoin;machine learning;genetic algorithm;post and pre covid,0,Conference,Springer Sponsored,"Predicting Bitcoin price is a universal research area as it attains significance in predicting the market way of its rate so that, investors could procure profits. Concurrently, with the evolution of Machine Learning (ML), researchers attempted to use ML based algorithms for forecasting the Bitcoin price. However, these researches have resulted in inefficient prediction due to error rate. For alleviating such pitfalls, this study intends to forecast the Bitcoin price by comparing its deviations pre and post Covid using suitable ML algorithms. To achieve this, the study proposes Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with Optimized Genetic Algorithm (OGA). In this case, ARIMA model is considered as it possess the innate ability in capturing standard temporal reliances which is distinct to time-series data. Further, hyperparameters are selected by GA based on the fitness function. Based on this, hyperparameter tuning is performed which assist to improvise the model performance. For determining if there exists any deviations in Bitcoin price (pre and post Covid), Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test is considered. Further, comparative analysis is regarded in accordance with performance metrics to validate the performance of the proposed system which proves its effectiveness in predicting Bitcoin price."

Cryptocurrency has grown widely in India and around the world among investors for financial activities like buying, selling, and trading. According to the report submitted in 2021 by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 7.3% of Indians owned cryptocurrency in 2021. In the past two years, i.e., 2020 and 2021, the value of global currencies have been falling due to the poor run of stock markets. So the investors found it very hard to cope with the economical issues. This in turn has led to a renewal of interest in digital currency. Our main target is to implement the efficient machine learning and deep learning- based models specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), long short term memory(LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to handle the price volatility of bitcoin and ethereum and to produce high accuracy."

Such a pursuit poses itself as one of the most formidable challenges within the realm of investments. In this study, the application of machine learning models is employed, while simultaneously comparing their prognostic capabilities to evaluate their performance in forecasting cryptocurrency price trends. Additionally, the normalization technique and the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature selection method are employed to effectively augment the aptitude for projecting cryptocurrency price trends. The prediction period encompasses the time span from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. The experimental findings reveal that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms other models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RFC), Naïve Bayes, and Long short-term memory (LSTM) when forecasting periods extend 7, 15, and 30 days beyond the present, respectively. However, when the forecast horizon is extended to 90 days, the LSTM model exhibits the most optimal performance. © 2023 IEEE."
real-time forecasting of time series in financial markets using sequentially trained dual-lstms,"gajamannage k., park y., jayathilake d.i.",expert systems with applications,2023,10.1016/j.eswa.2023.119879,financial markets; many-to-one lstm; real-time forecasting; sequential training; time series,0,Journal,Q1,"Financial markets are highly complex and volatile; thus, accurate forecasting of such markets is vital to make early alerts about crashes and subsequent recoveries. People have been using learning tools from diverse fields such as financial mathematics and machine learning to make trustworthy forecasting on such markets. However, the accuracy of such techniques had not been adequate until artificial neural network frameworks such as long short-term memory (LSTM) were utilized. Moreover, making accurate real-time forecasting, also known as nowcasting, of financial time series is highly subjective to the LSTM's architecture in use and the procedure of training it. Herein, we forecast financial markets in real-time by training a dual version of LSTM which forecasts only one time step at each iteration so that the forecast for this iteration will be in the input for the next iteration. Semi-convergence is a prominent issue in a recurrent LSTM setup as the error could propagate through iterations; however, the duality of this LSTM aids in dwindling this issue. Especially, we employ one LSTM to find the best number of epochs associated with the least loss and train the second LSTM only through that many epochs to make forecasting. We treat the current forecast as a part of the training set for the next forecast and train the same LSTM. While classic ways of training cause more error when the forecast is made further away through the test period, our approach offers superior accuracy as the training increases when it proceeds through the testing period. The forecasting accuracy of our approach is validated using three time series from each of the three diverse financial markets: stock, cryptocurrency, and commodity. The results are compared with those of a single LSTM, an extended Kalman filter, and an autoregressive integrated moving average model. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
revolutionize ai trading bots with automl-based multi-timeframe bitcoin price prediction,khurana s.s.; singh p.; garg n.k.,sn computer science,2023,10.1007/s42979-023-01941-8,algorithmic trading; automl; autosklearn; bitcoin price prediction; cryptocurrency; multi-timeframe analysis; tpot,0,Journal,Q3,"Multi-timeframe analysis/prediction provides essential information to traders. It gives a broader perspective of market trends and is used to identify significant levels of support and resistance. This will help traders/trading bots in making trading decisions. The majority of current studies focused on forecasting the closing price of daily candlesticks or high-frequency time frames, such as those of 1 min or 5 min. For artificially intelligent trading bots focusing on swing trading, price prediction related to other time frames is very significant. In this research, we present a study on developing a model to enable artificial intelligent-based trading bots to predict price components (open, high, low, and close prices) of the next 30-min, 1-h, and 4-h candlesticks of Bitcoin price. The study used two Auto-Machine Learning libraries: Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) and AutoSklearn, to find the most suitable model for the task. The models are trained on historical price data of Bitcoin, and technical indicators are computed on these data. The performance of the trained models is evaluated in terms of R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results showed that TPOT outperformed AutoSklearn library for all three time frames. It predicted all price components of 30-min candlestick with R2 Score of 0.999. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

The price of Bitcoin has gone through several cycles of highs and lows. As a result, it is a widely discussed topic, especially on platforms like Twitter. Sentiment analysis is a research area of Natural Language Processing. It is used to determine whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. Twitter tweets are more challenging to analyze when compared to other forms of text, due to the presence of irregular grammar, emoticons, and sarcasm. This study intends to analyze the effect of tweets on the stock price of Bitcoin. In order to study the effect, the sentiment associated with each tweet is calculated using VADER, and also the profession and follower count associated with verified users who tweet about bitcoin is found. Following this, a model is trained and tested using a combined dataset of tweet related data and historical bitcoin price data. It was found that the sentiment of tweets does correlate with the shift in the price of bitcoin.  © 2023 IEEE."
twitter sentiment analysis-based adjustment of cryptocurrency action recommendation model for profit maximization,park j.; seo y.-s.,ieee access,2023,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3273898,bitcoin; bitcoin action recommendation; cryptocurrency; deep learning; profit maximization; sentiment analysis,1,Journal,Q1,"Cryptocurrencies have recently attracted considerable attention, resulting in research mainly on deep learning-based price prediction models to maximize profit. Two research approaches have been adopted. Studies adopting the first approach directly predict the future cryptocurrency price. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), which show high performance in time-series data, are mainly used for this approach. Further, studies adopting the second approach recommend actions to investors to maximize profits, such as 'Sell', 'Buy', and 'Wait.' In this approach, classification models are used and results are derived based on probabilities. However, these action recommendation models do not consider the quality of the result. For example, it is risky to accept the result when the probability that the result of the action recommendation model for two classes is the correct answer is approximately 51%. To solve this problem, we recommend a method for adjusting the result of the action recommendation model based on Twitter sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed adjustment method improves the performance by approximately 3% compared to the conventional methods and are statistically validated. © 2013 IEEE."
